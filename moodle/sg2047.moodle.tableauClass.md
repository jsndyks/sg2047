We will be using **Tableau** throughout the module and for your coursework assignment. The software is installed on the computers in the University computer labs.
This page tells you how to access the software for use on your own computer(s).
We will start using **Tableau** in about week 03.

**Tableau** is commercial software for data visualization and visual analytics.
It has its roots in academia, with colleagues at Stanford University driving it forwards.
We will be using it in the lab at City throughout the module and you can install it on your own machines too under a _Student Course License_.

We will point you to some introductions, tutorials and materials, but you will need to spend plenty of time getting good at using **Tableau** in your own time to do well on the module.

<div class="postIt" markdown=1>

I can't emphasise this enough - **please put time into learning Tableau early on in the module, and continue to do so throughout the term**.

My experience of teaching visualization using **Tableau** shows that it is an empowering tool that really helps students develop skills and make sense of data.<br/>
Some students go on to use Tableau in placements, projects, further degrees and jobs subsequently, which is fantastic.<br/>
But this experience also reveals a close correlation between:

- early use of **Tableau**, experimentation with it, and use of the online support materials, and
- **success in the module**.

So please use **Tableau** early on and use the support materials to experiment with it and get to know it.

### Computer Labs at City St George's

**Tableau Desktop** is installed in the Windows PC labs at the University.

As I write this (_January 2025_), it is called **Tableau 2024.N** on these machines and available through the alphabetically grouped application folders on the **Start menu**.<br/>(_N is a number that will be low at the start of the term, but may increase with software updates!_)

You can use Tableau on any of the machines in the computer labs, library or open access areas to undertake the work that you is required of you during this module.

### Your Own Computer(s)

As students on SG2047 you can get free use of **Tableau** on your own computer during the course through a _Student Course License_ for which I have applied.
The license lasts until the end of September 2025.

The instructions from the _Academic Programs Team_ at _Tableau Software_ follows.<br/>They say: 


> Please forward these instructions to students enrolled on _SG2047 Visualizing Society_:

#### Tableau Desktop - Student Course License

Get _Tableau Desktop_ running on your own computer as follows ...

 1. [Sign into](https://identity.idp.tableau.com/login) an existing [Tableau.com](http://tableau.com/) account, or [create](https://id.tableau.com/register) a new account using your school-issued email - <code>@city.ac.uk</code> 
 2. Once signed in, visit the [Academic Quick Start page](https://www.tableau.com/tft/activation) to download the latest versions of _Tableau Desktop_
 3. Run _Tableau Desktop_ and activate it with this product key for **SG2047** 2024/25 : <code>TC5B-D6B3-3190-4025-15E1</code>
 4. Already have a copy of Tableau Desktop installed?<br/>
 Update the license key in the application:<br/>Help menu → Manage Product Keys

Having trouble?<br/>
The [Academic Quick Start page](https://www.tableau.com/tft/activation) includes FAQs and help articles.

Some helpful resources:

 * Check out Tableau’s [Free Training Videos](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training) and Tableau Public’s [How-To Videos](https://public.tableau.com/app/learn/how-to-videos)
 * Join the [Tableau Community](https://www.tableau.com/community) and explore the [Forums](https://community.tableau.com/s/explore-forums) to search and ask questions
 * For product support, review the [Knowledge Base](https://www.tableau.com/support/knowledgebase) and [Tableau Help](https://www.tableau.com/support/help) platform

If you use a Mac or Linux operating system, you may need to install specific drivers to run Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder. You can find relevant drivers [here](https://tableau.egnyte.com/dl/vIMFTUtHRu/Drivers.zip_). As a note, Tableau uses the Simba Spark driver to connect to Kyvos. These drivers are to be used for your instance of Tableau only and will be linked to your product key.

<!-- You should get your _Tableau_ license straightaway, but if not, there's a 14-day free trial, so you can get started immediately regardless! -->

### Tableau Public

There is also a free version of **Tableau** that only enables you to save and share data on _the cloud_ - [**Tableau Public**](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover).

This is **not** what you need for the module so **do not use Tableau Public** for your work on _SG2047 Visualizing Society_ .

You may need more functionality than it offers and since it makes all of your datasets available publicly this will not be not suitable for some the datasets we'll be using.
I reiterate this is not suitable for your coursework.

So please avoid sharing the work that you undertake in _SG2047 Visualizing Society_ or posting it online.
You may find it helpful later on when working on projects or on placements, but please just ignore [**Tableau Public**](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) completely while working on SG2047.

One the module is over, feel free to use your _Tableau_ and design skills to get involved in public data debate! But for now, use **Tableau Desktop**.

<!--- --- --->

### Training Videos

Tableau provide a whole host of [_Free Training Videos_](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824654).

Do use these excellent resources to learn **Tableau** and inform your work on the module.

You will find them extremely helpful as you master this important software for exploring and explaining structure in data as you visualize society.

Spend time searching through them, looking for tips, trying things out and mastering _Tableau_.

As most of you will have worked out, and sorry that it took me a while, _Tableau Software_ changed their means of providing students with free access to _Tableau Desktop_ about a month ago.

But we now have a solution as I have applied for, and received, a _Student Course License_ for SG2047.

Hopefully this is good news and will give you all access to _Tableau Desktop_ on your own machines - remember you can always use it on the computers in the University.

Instructions on how to use the _Student Course License_ to get _Tableau Desktop_ running on your computer are available on the updated [Tableau Desktop](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824653) page.

I have also added a [Tableau Desktop](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=892547) forum where we can discuss any issues associated with getting the software running and using it. I hope this is helpful.

Do let me know how you get on - in the [Tableau Desktop](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=892547) forum of course!

**Jason**
