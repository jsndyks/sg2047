### Week 08 : Coursework - Task 1 - FeedBACK

The provisional marks for Task 1 are released on Moodle. See the [GradeBook](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/grade/report/grader/index.php?id=45842) for marks and your original submission for feedback.

You will see an audio file attached to the submission and should check the submission itself for any notes or annotations - I added these in som (but not all) cases. Please also check the criteria - the _rubric_ as you have marks against each criterion.

Note that the marks are provisional and subject to change following :

- **moderation** - a check on the integrity and consistency of the marks;
- the **Board of Assessment** - external and internal examiners will review the marks in June to consider any accepted extenuating circumstances and to check that standards are consistent with other courses and modules;

So - **Nobody has passed or failed anything at all**. These are indicative marks, they are initial marks that give you a sense of how I think you are doing.

There is no opportunity or indeed need to resit / resubmit anything as yet. Please carry on learning on the module and use this _feedback_ to inform your approach.

There will be no discussion of individual marks before the Board of Assessment, but I can discuss performance in general terms and of course, enjoy chatting about visualization, design, Tableau ...!

### General issues ...

<!---img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/sg2047.202021.feedback.task1.png" width=400--->

On the whole - the standard of the work submitted was very good.

- detailed
- informed
- pleasing!

From what I have seen so far ... you have learned plenty!

Module mark is weighted average for Task 1 and Task 2:

> **Module Total = (Task1Mark x 0.3) + (Task2Mark x 0.7)**

Overall pass mark for the module is **40%**

### Examples

#### A Possible Encoding?

<!-- |Data|Detail|LoM|VV|Guidance|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|Scale of Geographic Entity|3 classes|Nominal|Shape|**G**|
|Scale of Geographic Entity|3 classes|Ordinal|Shape|**P**| -->

There seems to be a data channel that is not encoded in some of the graphics, where not all marks are countries. Marks in some of the _scatter-plots_ that you selected represent continents and even the World.

- [Children per woman vs population growth, 2020](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-vs-population-growth?tab=chart&country=&region=World)

Can we also encode _Scale of Geographic Entity_?
We might consider this to be **nominal**, and **SHAPE** would work well here according to the guidance.

But, if you think about it, there is an **order** to scale, and Roth's guidance suggests that this doesn't work well for order.

<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/week08.dnaTable.feedback.png" width=600/>

But, can we use **SHAPE** for _Scale of Geographic Entity_?

Is this an _ordinal_ shape encoding that is likely to work?

 <img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/continentShape.png" width=200/>

The extent to which a shape is _open_ or _filled_ may enable us to interpret **order**. The **SHAPES** can carry **HUE**, and so we can relate them to continents. And as continents and _World_ are bigger than countries the larger open shapes may help us with the occlusion / **DETECTION** problem.

It's a plausible design idea!
_What do you think?_

#### Inconsistent Colour Encoding?

In some of the graphics, _grey_ is used for both aggregations of countries into _continents_ or _World_ and also _NoData_.

- [Children per woman vs population growth, 2020](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-vs-population-growth?tab=chart&country=&region=World)

This fails the **CONSISTENCY** test.

Also, _SouthAmerica_ and _Africa_ are very similar colours, which makes them hard to **DISCRIMINATE**. It is harder to **DISCRIMINATE** colours where sizes of marks that carry the colour are smaller.

<p style="padding-left:4em"><img width=100 height=120  src="./ourWorldInData.key.continents.png"/></p>

And yet there is _STRUCTURE_ in the nominal data. _South America_ and _North America_ share a continent, or a 'mega-continent' (America). As **HUE** is _associative_ we may want to give these two **nominal** categories a similar **HUE** so that we can identify this relationship when we are trying to **ASSEMBLE** patterns in the data?

We might vary **LIGHTNESS** to differentiate between the _North_ (darker) and _South_ (lighter) hemispheres?

| Data      | Detail                         | LoM     | VV        | Guidance |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------- | --------- | -------- |
| Geography | Hemisphere<br/>(north / south) | Nominal | Lightness | P        |
| Geography | 5 Mega-Continents              | Nominal | Hue       | G        |

It's a plausible design idea!
_What do you think?_
_Can we justify that **P** (poor) for **Guidance** (according to Roth) as there are only two categories in our **LIGHTNESS** geography encoding?_

#### Detection Strategies

<!-- Look for omissions:
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/depression-by-level-of-education-employment?time=earliest..latest&country=~GBR%20 -->

There is a _trade-off_ between **ESTIMATION** and **DETECTION** and **ASSEMBLY** and **PROPORTION** in use of _Logarithmic_ (log) scales!

- [Share of one-person households vs. GDP per capita, 2016](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/one-person-households-vs-gdp-per-capita)

We can scale quantities if we have a skewed distribution and want to :

- spread similar values visually out to **DETECT** them;
- see relationships that are not linear through graphical **ASSEMBLY**

Various strategies exist in these graphics for for **DETECTION** and **ASSEMBLY** :

- _layering_ - plotting the smaller marks on top of the larger ones allows us to see the smaller marks but perhaps reduces apparent size of larger symbols - **PROPORTION** compromise
- _opacity_ - making the marks semi-opaque allows us to see overlaps but reduces resolution of colour encoding - **DISCRIMINATION** compromise
- _log scale_ - moves clustered marks apart but makes it hard to estimate quantities - **PROPORTION** compromise

### HeurVIStics!

Some clarifications regarding a few of the _Data Visualization Design Tests_ ...

#### The VARIATION Test

This test is about the _level of measurement_ in the data and the encoding applied.
Use the guidance from Roth, Munzner and [Brewer](http://colorbrewer.org) to make judgments about whether the encodings are appropriate.

<!---
I saw very little on [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/), which is an excellent and informative resource. Do have a play - check the [Lecture Links]() from
--->
<!---
Please have a look and check the [Module Video Stream](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2552891) for an introduction to **ColorBrewer** - try [SG2047 - Week 05 - Effective Data Graphics](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/860dc5cf-a87b-4f1a-8dba-a9738c1c7900)from about <code>1:25:30</code>
--->

Level of measurement by _Munzner_ ...

- Identity - Nominal
- Magnitude - Ordinal, Interval, Ratio

Some of you considered **numeric data**, data with **magnitudes**, to be nominal.
Nominal means **named** - named only, with no order or quantity.

See the [Guidance Documents](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2381642) from the _Effective Data Graphics_ class.

<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/sg2047-1718-EffectiveEncoding.lecture.slides.lom.png" width=600/>

And then we are interested in whether or not _effective_ visual channels are employed.

Again, the [Guidance Documents](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2381642) from the _Effective Data Graphics_ class helps here.

The slides from that session - including Robert Roth's table - let you make and justify judgments about the encoding.

They explain the qualities of the visual variables, and how well they work - _SYNTACTICS_.

<!--img src="http://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/roth.2015.Fig2.png" width=600/-->

Which visual variables work best for which type of expressiveness?

#### The PROPORTION Test

<div style="float:right">
<img src="http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/how-are-smartphones-being-used_50290d681546b.jpeg" width=200 style='padding-left:2em'/>
<img src="http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/now-wash-your-hands_50290a5c5ebd6.gif" width=400 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

Sometimes you need to get our a ruler to check this through.

Let's look at some examples from beyond **Our World in Data**.

Consider the lengths of the bars about social media on the right.
Is the bar for _Watching Videos_ (54%) more than three times the length of the bar for _Tweeting_ (15%)?

Look at the x-axis in the [Now Wash You Hands](http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/how-are-smartphones-being-used_50290d681546b.jpeg) graphic on the right - produced before anybody had heard of _COVID-19_!

Consider the positions and values of the first three circles on the x-axis..?
Consider the variation in the Y axis.

The proportion test applies to components of colour as well as position, length, size, angle ...

Now wash your hands!

---

#### The POSITION Test

<div style="float:right">
<img src="http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/the-planets-to-scale-in-true-colour_5049125ad854b.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

Don't forget **LOCATION** or **POSITION** - a few of you did!

Really think hard about how your graphic is using **LOCATION** / **POSITION**?
This defines the kind of chart you produce and the kinds of relationships that your graphic will enable you to detect.

How is **LOCATION** or **POSITION** being used in this graphic of [The Planets to Scale](http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/the-planets-to-scale-in-true-colour_5049125ad854b.png)?

> **BUT**: Can you think of another TEST that it passes?

In _maps_ the position of items on the ground is encoded through their **LOCATION** or **POSITION** in the graphic.
And this really limits our ability to use **location** or **position** to :

- line things up
- encode magnitudes
- etc.

So we are always having to use less expressive and effective encodings for the qualities and quantities that we want to put encode in the map, such as :

- colour (value, hue, saturation)
- size

We have to move down Munzner's chart (see above) some way when we are producing maps that use _position_ to encode geography.

In other graphics, work out what coordinate system is being used ...

- Cartesian? (such as a map or a scatter plot)
- radial? (like a pie chart)
- ranking (ordered)
- ... or what!

If one aspect or dimension (for example - the Y axis) of **LOCATION** or **POSITION** is not being used -- then there is room for a more relational, comparative, data dense graphic by using it to encoding a data channel.

And just because a graphic is about _places_, does not mean that the _geographic relationships_ between these places, their positions on the ground, or the _geography_, need to be encoded. There is nothing in either of these two graphics that enables us to estimate, interpret or use the positions of these cities and countries in our analysis of the data.

- [When Sea Levels Attack](http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/when-sea-levels-attack_50290a5ae4576.jpg)
- [Did You Know Some Countries Require Vacation?](http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/did-you-know-some-countries-require-you-to-take-a-vacation_50355401c1810.jpg)

 <div style="float:right">

<img src="http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/when-sea-levels-attack_50290a5ae4576.jpg" width=400 style='padding-left:2em' />
<img src="http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/did-you-know-some-countries-require-you-to-take-a-vacation_50355401c1810.jpg" width=400 style='padding-left:2em' />
</div>

<div style="clear:both"/>

So **geography** is not encoded in the first graphic (other than in the mini maps).
And **geography** is only encoded in the second graphic with **HUE** (other than the weird map label).

Some examples to consider, deconstruct and discuss ...

Let's deconstruct :

* data channels
* visual channels

Let's think about the _Data Visualization Design Tests_ :

 * *The PROXIMITY Test*

 ** _Are things that have similar characteristics close together?_

 * *The POSITION Test*

 ** _Is *POSITION* used to show the most important relationships between information?_

 * *The CONSISTENCY Test*

 ** _Is *HUE* used consistently across the graphic to show relationships between items?_
 ** _Use encodings *CONSISTENTLY* across a composite graphic_

* data channels?
* size of data matrix
* visual channels
  - *position*?
  - *colour* - check http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=9[ColorBrewer]

How about the _Data Visualization Design Tests_ :

 * The *EFFICIENCY* Test

 ** _Is any *DOUBLE ENCODING* necessary and justified when used for emphasis?_

#### Chinese City Size

http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/the-chinese-population_50290a6cd2104.gif[The Long Tail]

Let's deconstruct :

* data channels
* visual channels
* level of measurement

Let's consider the **DNA** of the graphic ...

====
* _URBAN AREA POPULATION_ - RATIO - SIZE
* _URBAN AREA POPULATION_ - ORDINAL - SATURATION
* _URBAN AREA POPULATION_ - BINARY (whether <2 million) - HUE
* _URBAN AREA POPULATION_ - ORDINAL - LOCATION (y)
====

 * The *EFFICIENCY* Test

 ** _Is any *DOUBLE ENCODING* necessary and justified when used for emphasis?_

Basically, *four* different visual channels are being used to encode a single data channel here in what is thus a relatively inefficient data graphic that does not support comparison.

And how is **Text** being used ...

* The *ANNOTATION* Test

** _Are visually differentiable *LABELS* used to identify and annotate important features?_
** _visually differentiate label types_

====
* _Chinese cities_ - NOMINAL - SIZE
* _Chinese cities_ - NOMINAL - BRIGHTNESS
* _Hong Kong and Taiwan_ - NOMINAL - ITALICS
