### Week 08 : Coursework - Task 1 - FeedBACK

The provisional marks for Task 1 are released on Moodle. See the [GradeBook](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/grade/report/grader/index.php?id=45842) for marks and your original submission for feedback.

You will see an audio file attached to the submission and should check the submission itself for any _notes_ or _annotations_ - I added these in some, but not all, cases. Please also check the criteria - the _rubric_ - as you have been awarded marks against each criterion.

Note that the marks are provisional and subject to change following :

- **moderation** - a check on the integrity and consistency of the marks;
- the **Board of Assessment** - external and internal examiners will review the marks in June to consider any accepted extenuating circumstances and to check that standards are consistent with other courses and modules;

So - **Nobody has passed or failed anything at all, yet**.<br/> These are indicative, rather than final module, marks.
They are initial marks that give you a sense of how I think you are doing.

There is no opportunity or indeed need to resit or resubmit anything as yet. Please carry on learning on the module and use this _feedback_ to inform your approach.

There will be no discussion of individual marks before the Board of Assessment, but I can discuss performance in general terms and of course, enjoy chatting about visualization, design, Tableau ...!

### General issues ...

<!---img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/sg2047.202021.feedback.task1.png" width=400--->

On the whole - the standard of the work submitted was very good.

- detailed
- informed
- pleasing!

Summary stats follow ...

|        Summary Stats | &nbsp; |
| -------------------: | -----: |
|        _Submissions_ | **29** |
|      _Passing Marks_ | **29** |
|    _Non-Submissions_ |  **2** |
|               _Mean_ | **64** |
|             _Median_ | **65** |
|    _75th Percentile_ | **69** |

Or, in the language of graphics ...

<div class='imgBox' style='float:center; align:center'>
<img width=400  src="./sg2047.task1.MarksDistribution.png"/>
</div>

From what I have seen so far ... you have learned plenty!

The module mark is weighted average for Task 1 and Task 2:

> **Module Total = (Task1Mark x 0.3) + (Task2Mark x 0.7)**

Overall pass mark for the module is **40%**

### Examples

#### An Additional Encoding? (_of an unencoded data channel_)

There seems to be a data channel that is not encoded in some of the graphics, where not all marks are countries. Marks in some of the _scatter-plots_ that you selected represent continents and even the World.

- [Children per woman vs population growth, 2020](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-vs-population-growth?tab=chart&country=&region=World)

Can we also encode _Scale of Geographic Entity_?
We might consider this to be **nominal**, and **SHAPE** would work well here according to the guidance.

| Data                       | Detail    | LoM     | VV    | Guidance |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------- | ----- | -------- |
| Scale of Geographic Entity | 3 classes | Nominal | Shape | **G**    |

But, if you think about it, there is an **order** to scale, and Roth's guidance suggests that this doesn't work well for order.

| Data                       | Detail    | LoM     | VV    | Guidance |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------- | ----- | -------- |
| Scale of Geographic Entity | 3 classes | Ordinal | Shape | **P**    |

<!---img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/week08.dnaTable.feedback.png" width=600/--->

But, can we use **SHAPE** for _Scale of Geographic Entity_?

Is this an _ordinal_ shape encoding that is likely to work?<br/>From more to less open (or less to more filled)?

 <img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/continentShape.png" width=200/>

The extent to which a shape is _open_ or _filled_ may enable us to interpret **order**. The **SHAPES** can still carry **HUE**, and so we can relate them to continents. And as continents and _World_ are bigger than countries the larger open shapes may help us with the occlusion / **DETECTION** problem that tends to occur in scatter plots.

It's a plausible design idea!
_What do you think?_

#### Inconsistent Colour Encoding?

In some of the graphics, _grey_ is used for both aggregations of countries into _continents_ or _World_ and also _NoData_.

- [Children per woman vs population growth, 2020](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-vs-population-growth?tab=chart&country=&region=World)

This fails the **CONSISTENCY** test.

Also, _SouthAmerica_ and _Africa_ are very similar colours, which makes them hard to **DISCRIMINATE**. It is harder to **DISCRIMINATE** colours where sizes of marks that carry the colour are smaller.

<p style="padding-left:4em"><img width=100 height=120  src="./ourWorldInData.key.continents.png"/></p>

And yet there is **STRUCTURE** in the nominal data. _South America_ and _North America_ share a continent, or a 'mega-continent' (America). As **HUE** is _associative_ we may want to give these two **nominal** categories a similar **HUE** so that we can identify this relationship when we are trying to **ASSEMBLE** patterns in the data?

We might additionally vary **LIGHTNESS** to differentiate between the _North_ (darker) and _South_ (lighter) hemispheres?

| Data      | Detail                         | LoM     | VV        | Guidance |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------- | --------- | -------- |
| Geography | Hemisphere<br/>(north / south) | Nominal | Lightness | P        |
| Geography | 5 Mega-Continents              | Nominal | Hue       | G        |

It's a plausible design idea!
It enable us to encode spatial relationships between The Americas and the Northern and Southern hemispheres - two additional geographic data channels.
_What do you think?_
_Can we justify that **P** (poor) for **Guidance** (according to Roth) as there are only two categories in our **LIGHTNESS** geography encoding?_

|        &nbsp; | Our World in Data                                                               | With Structured Categories                                                               | Lightness Only<br/><span style="font-size:80%">Same colour - zero saturation</span>     |

The right hand column above reduces _SATURATION_ to 0%, and so we can see how _LIGHTNESS_ varies within the structured colour scheme - to show North/South hemispheres.

#### Detection Strategies

<!-- Look for omissions:
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/depression-by-level-of-education-employment?time=earliest..latest&country=~GBR%20 -->

There is a _trade-off_ between **ESTIMATION** and **DETECTION** and **ASSEMBLY** and **PROPORTION** in use of _Logarithmic_ (log) scales!

- [Share of one-person households vs. GDP per capita, 2016](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/one-person-households-vs-gdp-per-capita)

We can scale quantities if we have a skewed distribution and want to :

- spread similar values visually out to **DETECT** them;
- see relationships that are not linear through graphical **ASSEMBLY**

Various strategies exist in these graphics for for **DETECTION** and **ASSEMBLY** :

- _layering_ - plotting the smaller marks on top of the larger ones allows us to see the smaller marks but perhaps reduces apparent size of larger symbols - **PROPORTION** compromise
- _opacity_ - making the marks semi-opaque allows us to see overlaps but reduces resolution of colour encoding - **DISCRIMINATION** compromise
- _openness_ - open shapes allow us to see overlaps but reduce our ability to apply and detect colour encoding - **DETECTION** compromise
- _log scale_ - moves clustered marks apart but makes it hard to estimate quantities - **PROPORTION** compromise

### HeurVIStics!

Some clarifications regarding a few of the _Data Visualization Design Tests_ ...

#### The VARIATION Test

This test is about the _level of measurement_ in the data and the encoding applied.
Use the guidance from Roth, Munzner and [Brewer](http://colorbrewer.org) to make judgments about whether the encodings are appropriate.

<!---
I saw very little on [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/), which is an excellent and informative resource. Do have a play - check the [Lecture Links]() from
--->
<!---
Please have a look and check the [Module Video Stream](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2552891) for an introduction to **ColorBrewer** - try [SG2047 - Week 05 - Effective Data Graphics](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/860dc5cf-a87b-4f1a-8dba-a9738c1c7900)from about <code>1:25:30</code>
--->

Level of measurement by _Munzner_ ...

- Identity - Nominal
- Magnitude - Ordinal, Interval, Ratio

Some of you considered **numeric data**, data with **magnitudes**, to be nominal.
Nominal means **named** - named only, with no order or quantity.

See the [Guidance Documents](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2381642) from the _Effective Data Graphics_ class.

<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/sg2047-1718-EffectiveEncoding.lecture.slides.lom.png" width=600/>

And then we are interested in whether or not _effective_ visual channels are employed.

Again, the [Guidance Documents](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2381642) from the _Effective Data Graphics_ class helps here.

The slides from that session - including Robert Roth's table - let you make and justify judgments about the encoding.

They explain the qualities of the visual variables, and how well they work - _SYNTACTICS_.

<!--img src="http://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/roth.2015.Fig2.png" width=600/-->

Which visual variables work best for which type of expressiveness?

##### Roth's Guidance

<img width=600 src ="http://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/roth.2016.Fig1.png"/>

#### The ESTIMATION Test

- _can you **ESTIMATE** quantities from items? quickly, consistently and accurately_

Tamara Munzner's _Ordered Magnitude Channels_ rank visual variables in terms of their effectiveness for estimation tasks.

##### Munzner's Rankings

<img width=600 src="http://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/sg2047-17-04-Design.lecture.slides.mag.png" />

Munzner also has rankings for _identity_. How well do the visual variables that have _associative_ properties work for establishing and differentiating between the identities that occur in _nominal_ data?

#### The PROPORTION Test

Sometimes you need to get out a ruler to check this through.

If you look closely at **Our World in Data** some examples do note encode population via size in ways that pass the **PROPORTION** test:

- [Children per woman vs population growth, 2020](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-vs-population-growth?tab=chart&country=&region=World)

<div style="float:right">
<img src="./img/ourWorldInData.PROPORTION.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

Here many countries,including _Tanzania_ and _Faroe Islands_, have circles that are identical size despite populations that are very different.
In the case of _Tanzania_ and _Faroe Islands_ the difference is huge: 3 orders of magnitude. That's right, there are 53,000 in the _Faroe Islands_ and 63,000,000 people in _Tanzania_.

<div style="clear:both"/>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="./img/ourWorldInData.PROPORTION.compare.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

Presumably there is a minimum size for each dot, and presumably this is so that the graphic passes the **DETECTION** test.

We can see this even more clearly if we break the **PROXIMITY** test and move the marks closer together.

<div style="clear:both"/>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="./img/visually.howAreSmartPhonesBeingUsed.png" width=200 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

Let's look at some examples from beyond **Our World in Data**.

Consider the lengths of the bars about social media on the right.
Is the bar for _Watching Videos_ (54%) more than three times the length of the bar for _Tweeting_ (15%)?

<div style="clear:both"/>

<div style="float:right">
<!---img src="./img/visually.howAreSmartPhonesBeingUsed.png" width=200 style='padding-left:2em'/--->
<img src="./img/visually.nowWashYourHands.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

Look at the x-axis in the [Now Wash You Hands](https://visual.ly/community/Infographics/health/now-wash-your-hands) graphic on the right - produced before anybody had heard of _COVID-19_!

Consider the positions and values of the first four circles on the x-axis ..? Particularly _MRSA_ and _HIV_.
Consider the variation in the Y axis.
Why do we have labels for X-axis values (that are easy to estimate on a linear scale) rather than on the Y-axis (which uses a much more cognitivelsy demanding log scale)?

The proportion test applies to components of colour as well as position, length, size, angle ...

Now wash your hands!

<div style="clear:both"/>

---

#### The POSITION Test

<div style="float:right">
<img src="./img/planets-to-scale.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

Don't forget **LOCATION** or **POSITION** - a few of you did!

Really think hard about how your graphic is using **LOCATION** / **POSITION**?
This defines the kind of chart you produce and the kinds of relationships that your graphic will enable you to detect.

How is **LOCATION** or **POSITION** being used in this graphic of [The Planets to Scale](https://space-facts.com/the-planets-to-scale/)?

> **BUT**: Can you think of another TEST that it passes?

In _maps_ the position of items on the ground is encoded through their **LOCATION** or **POSITION** in the graphic.
And this really limits our ability to use **location** or **position** to :

- line things up
- encode magnitudes
- etc.

So we are always having to use less expressive and effective encodings for the qualities and quantities that we want to put encode in the map, such as :

- colour (value, hue, saturation)
- size

We have to move down Munzner's chart (see above) some way when we are producing maps that use _position_ to encode geography.

In other graphics, work out what coordinate system is being used ...

- Cartesian? (such as a map or a scatter plot)
- radial? (like a pie chart)
- ranking (ordered)
- ... or what!

If one aspect or dimension (for example - the Y axis) of **LOCATION** or **POSITION** is not being used -- then there is room for a more relational, comparative, data dense graphic by using it to encoding a data channel.

<div style="float:right">
<img src="./img/informationIsBeautiful.whenSeaLevelsAttack.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em' />
</div>

And just because a graphic is about _places_, does not mean that the _geographic relationships_ between these places, their positions on the ground, or the _geography_, need to be encoded.

- [When Sea Levels Attack](https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/when-sea-levels-attack-2/)

<div style="clear:both"/>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="./img/visually.someCountriesRequireVacation.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em' />
</div>

- [Did You Know Some Countries Require Vacation?](https://visual.ly/community/Infographics/business/did-you-know-some-countries-require-you-take-vacation)

There is nothing in either of these two graphics that enables us to estimate, interpret or use the positions of these cities and countries in our analysis of the data.

Could we add a geographic encoding to help us see how things vary spatially?

So **geography** is not encoded in the first graphic (other than in the mini maps).
And **geography** is only encoded in the second graphic with **HUE** (other than the weird map label), which does not enable us to see spatial variation very well as it has no order and so is a **P**oor visual variable for encoding ordinal and numeric data channels).

<div style="clear:both"/>

Let's deconstruct :

Let's consider the **DNA** of the graphic ...

====
* _URBAN AREA POPULATION_ - RATIO - SIZE
* _URBAN AREA POPULATION_ - ORDINAL - SATURATION
* _URBAN AREA POPULATION_ - BINARY (whether <2 million) - HUE
* _URBAN AREA POPULATION_ - ORDINAL - LOCATION (y)
====

 * The *EFFICIENCY* Test

 ** _Is any *DOUBLE ENCODING* necessary and justified when used for emphasis?_

Basically, *four* different visual channels are being used to encode a single data channel here in what is thus a relatively inefficient data graphic that does not support comparison.

And how is **Text** being used ...

* The *ANNOTATION* Test

** _Are visually differentiable *LABELS* used to identify and annotate important features?_
** _visually differentiate label types_
