Morning!

## HOMEWORK!

I have added a HomeWork link to the Week 08 page on Moodle.
This outlines the work you need to be getting on with this week.

 - Feedback - so you know how you did in Coursework Task 1 (updated)
 - FeedForward - to help you get going on Coursework task 2

https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1853279

Remember that we can discuss interpretations of the Task 2 coursework for ONE WEEK ONLY, so you need to engage and check whether you require any clarifications right away.

## VIDEO!

I have also uploaded the 90 mins that I recorded yesterday during our class. The audio is not fantastic ... I still sound a bit like a robot impersonating Cher in places ... and I have not edited the transcript.
So - if you need help understanding sections then let me know where in the video with a message in the 'VIDEO STREAM ISSUES' channel on Teams:

https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a8caedf32efa54fcb8fd771a7310f9fff%40thread.tacv2/VIDEO%2520STREAM%2520ISSUES?groupId=649c1a9d-adeb-4c7c-bbed-83f8c9ef88a3&tenantId=dd615949-5bd0-4da0-ac52-28ef8d336373

I will do my best to try and document what I was saying!

## DISCUSSION!

Note that I have Open Drop-In sessions at the following times this week:
  * 9am Weds
  * 9am Friday

Just drop me a line in Teams if you would like to chat or all and we can discuss any of the stuff we have bee doing in the module.

## FEEDBACK!

Finally, some of you are unable to see marks in the Grader Report.
I can't explain this, but have asked the tech support folks to investigate.
It's obviously important that you get this feedback ASAP.
They are usually pretty quick!

Jason.

**PREPARATION**<br/>
Please check the [Week 08 - Homework](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1853279) and get on with this before class. It will get you started on [Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=37070#section-17).<br/>

If you have not yet added an image with some findings to the [MS Teams Channel](https://j.mp/sg2047team21) or discussed the graphics that others have made, now would be a good time to participate!
