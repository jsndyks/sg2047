###  Week 08 : Coursework - Task 2 - FeedFORWARD


#### Outcomes and Rubric

Check the intended [Module Learning Outcomes](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1610990) to make sure you know what skills, knowledge and values you are expected to exhibit in the work. This is what we will be looking for.

<div style="float:right; padding-right:4em; padding:2em"><img src="http://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/rubric.logo.png" width=32/></div>

Make sure you know where to find the rubric!
This describes the standards required against each criterion to achieve particular marks. Click this logo in the [Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic - INSTRUCTIONS & SUBMISSION](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=1831819)

 * You may have to click '*Add submission*' to see the logo ...?

> **IMPORTANT:** Following any discussion and clarification ...
*the rubric will be updated within **one week**!*
I will inform you by email when this has been done.

#### Data

 * Get the example workbook from the Moodle Assessment section - this is your starting point
   * [Task 2 : Data - Census 2011 Key Variables for London LSOAs - Tableau Workbook](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=1611057)
 * Find _your focus_ - a *Geographic Subset* consisting of the LSOAs in a few Boroughs, just for you
   * [Task 2 : Individual Focus - Geographic Subsets](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1611056) ...
 * Make a _set_ containing your boroughs
 * Rename the _set_ so that the name makes sense to you - e.g. '_My LSOAs_' or '_Central South-West London_'
 * Filter - so that these are the only boroughs you can see (you'll be dealing with many LSOAs within them)

**NOTE:** So your process might be ...

1. get data;
2. find your region - _a Geographic Subset of LSOAs in a few boroughs, just for you ..._;
1. make a set;
1. rename the set;
1. filter!

#### Clarification

##### Words
Keep to the word counts in each section  of the _Commentary_  - **250 words per section**.

##### Interaction / Static

You will be submitting a _PNG graphic_ -- so this will not enable the markers to interact with the data at all:
 * no tooltips, no selection, no filtering, no highlighting

Imagine the whole graphic is printed on (high resolution, colour) paper for use as a poster and design for this.

 * "_**static** graphics_", "_**static** image_"

 * "_it cannot rely upon any interaction or dynamic features such as tooltips, filtering, highlighting, etc._".

#### Boroughs

The boroughs are simply a means of allocating a well-defined and different subset of the LSOAs in London to each of you. You need to show that you can represent data for multiple themes and multiple variables in all of your LSOAs concurrently.
So please don't simplify to Borough level or use Boroughs as a means of comparison.

In a way we can think of Boroughs as an arbitrary aggregation of LSOAs and a false imposition of structure on a society that operates at a much finer level of detail.

So we don't want this level of aggregation - it hides detail!

|Unemployment - Borough (SUM)|Unemployment - Borough (AVG)|
|---|---|---|
|<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/k045.bar.png" width=200 /> |<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/k045.bar.average.png" width=200 /> |<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/k045.dots.png" width=200 />|

But, more importantly, using *SUM* (left) is unhelpful as it is adding ratios, or proportions ... this makes little sense.
We are adding percentages in this case, which tells us more about how many LSOAs there are in a borough than anything else.
If you think about it, an average (right) is more informative.

|Unemployment - Borough (AVG)|Unemployment - by LSOA|
|---|---|
|<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/k045.bar.average.scaled.png" width=200 />|<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/k045.dots.png" width=200 />

But even this hides detail - with just one figure per Borough!
Good visualization design lets us see much more detail and more nuanced variation with **data dense** graphics.
LOOK! If we plot unemployment levels for all LSOAs we can see that there is more variation **within** boroughs than **between** them. The average figures of around 7 and around 4 are not at all informative about the variation within boroughs.

#### Quantities and Ratios

Don't produce maps of themes that show population by mistake by using TOTALS and SUMS - use RATIOs:

 * see [xkcd Pet Peeve #208](https://xkcd.com/1138/)

Focus on proportions of people with particular characteristics in your areas.

Total population tells us how many people live in an area - but this is a function of the size of the area itself.

It's more useful to map **population density** - the number of people per unit area, hectare in this sense. This tells us how closely people live together in an area independently of its size. So we can compare conditions in big areas and small areas.


|Total Population|Population Density|
|---|---|
|<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/totalPop.png" width=400 />|<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/popDensity.png" width=400 />

But, in London, densities are dependent upon the presence of open spaces such as parks. We can see these if we select different background maps - see <b>Map, Map Layers</b> and use semi-opaque colours. Click for details.

|Population Density|Population Density & Map|
|---|---|
|<a href="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/popDensity.png"><img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/popDensity.png" width=400 /></a>|<a href="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/popDensityMap.png"><img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/popDensityMap.png" width=400 /></a>

#### Themes

Look for interesting patterns within individual themes initially - I have suggested themes for each of you to work on initially in the [Task 2 : Individual Focus - Geographic Subsets](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1611056).

<!-- |Theme|Variables|
|---|---|
|Age Structure|k001-k006|
|Ethnicity and Language|k012-k023|
|Household Composition & Tenure|k024-k034|
|Illness & Care|k035-k036|
|Education|k026, k037-k40|
|Work & Transport|k041-k47|
|Employment|k046-k60| -->

<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/week08.themeTable.png" width=400/>


Then have a look for differences, trends and relationships between themes.

#### Submission

Please read the submission details carefully ...

 1. *DASHBOARD* - *PNG* format
   * size must be **1654*1169**
   * use annotations
   * you should _not_ submit the Tableau workbook - so all assumptions, workings and decisions need to be described in the *commentary*

**NOTE**: so, following some Exploration, you might decide to ...

1. make story that is the right size (_or use the example in the Workbook_!);
2. add graphics (create and add _worksheets_);
3. arrange them to develop a narrative (use the dashboard _Layout_ tab);
4. annotate the _worksheets_ and the _dashboard_ with labels;
5. export as PNG

2. *COMMENTARY* - text only - use the **Online Text** box
 * ***description** - 250 words*
 _find differences, detect trends and compare places_
 * ***encodings** - 250 words*
 _select one data-dense graphic and describe and justify the encodings -- use Roth and Munzner to inform your views_ - **_no tables!_**
 * ***decisions** - 250 words*
 _show how you have used your knowledge of visualization design, including the Design Tests for Data Visualization, to inform your graphics and decisions_
 * ***reflection** - 250 words* - +
 _document the most important principles, decisions and challenges and your description of what you have learned_

> **NOTE**: remember that we will use a _screen reader_ to read your commentary aloud as we are looking at your graphics.
You might want to run your script through a screen reader to hear how it sounds.

 3. *REFERENCES* - PDF
  * full references to any work cited in the submission -- including lecture notes;
  * use Harvard, APA or a similar referencing system
  * no other content

> **IMPORTANT**: You need to make **three** submissions.
> All *must* be submitted before the deadline.
> Anything submitted after the deadline will not be marked.
> You can upload in advance of the deadline and overwrite submissions subsequently.

#### Communication
There are lots of ways to get in touch with me and to discuss your work ...

* use the [MS Teams Channel](https://bit.ly/sg2047team21) to raise issues and answer each other's queries
* come to the classes - most of the sessions will involve practical work that relates directly to the coursework - especially in [week 11](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=37070#section-15) when we have a _Coursework Workshop_.
* e-mail me - I receive _lots_ of e-mail and am _never_ on top of this, but usually respond within a few days.
<!-- * come and find me in my office - _401e_ - during my open office hours. -->
* better still - use **MS Teams** chat during my _Office Hours_.
There is no need to book in advance.
Here's a link to [my online diary](http://gicentre.net/jsndyks/diary) and a [list of open-office sessions](http://j.mp/cityCSdropInJD). You can just call me on the **MS Teams** chat, unannounced during drop-in sessions. I am either helping students who arrived before you or waiting for students to show up!


If you would like clarification on the coursework instructions, please make contact within one week of the release of the coursework.

> **IMPORTANT**: I will discuss the coursework instructions and answer questions about their interpretation for *ONE WEEK* following the release of the coursework. If you have questions or require clarifications then please let me know and I will do my best to address these.
_If necessary_, I will produce an updated version of the coursework instructions after this period, with edits highlighted and inform you that an update has been made.
After this period I am of course happy to discuss your progress on the coursework and to help you explore, design and problem solve, but I will not be commenting _on the Coursework Instructions_ or _their interpretation_.
