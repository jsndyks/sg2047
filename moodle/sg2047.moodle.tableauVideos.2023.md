I **strongly recommend** that you spend at least **an hour or two** watching the following training videos and experimenting with the concepts and functionality that they introduce in Tableau.

These concepts are key to your successful use of Tableau, and it is essential that you understand them. Spend time with these videos **before reading week**.

Being able to use these ideas and the functionality that relies upon them now will help you immeasurably in using Tableau to **Explore** and **Explain** effectively as you learn to _visualize society_ and develop designs and ideas in your coursework assignment.

### 1. Sorting

<ul><li><a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/sorting">https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/sorting</a></li></ul>
<p>Sorting is a great way of <b>relating data sets</b>. Bars that show one variable and use position to rank or order by another allow us to see relationships. This tutorial shows us how to use position to encode data in graphics and make your charts more data dense and relational.<br/>

### 2. Creating Sets

<ul><li><a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/creating-sets">https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/creating-sets</a></li></ul>
<p>Use <b>sets</b> to define, identify and encode items in your data set that have particular characteristics. These help you <b>Explore</b> by relating data items that have similarities in one view in another and <b>Explain</b> by adding an <em>identity</em> or <em>category</em>  to particular items - that you can then encode. You can think of set membership as being an additional categorical variable that you add to your data ... and you can add as many of these as you like.<br/>

### 3. Calculations

<ul><li><a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started-calculations">https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started-calculations</a></li></ul>
<p>Explains how you to create new variables from existing ones using simple mathematics and conditions. This helps you create ratios and differences as you <b>compare</b> variables.<br/>

### 4. Understanding Pill Types

<ul><li><a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/understanding-pill-types">https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/understanding-pill-types</a></li></ul>
<p>Outlines the differences between dimensions and measures, and the differences between continous (<em>numeric</em>) and discrete (<em>categorical</em>) data.
Tableau deals with each of these differently and understanding this is core to your use of Tableau. <B>ESSENTIAL</b>!<br/>
<b>5 mins</b></p>

### 5. Aggregation, Granularity, and Ratio Calculations

<ul><li><a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/aggregation-granularity-and-ratio-calculations">https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/aggregation-granularity-and-ratio-calculations</a></li></ul>
<p>Granularity and Aggregation are important cocnepts in using Tableau. Understanding how Tableau aggregates rows in the data set and uses the <em>detail</em> pill to group rows is essential to understanding how Tableau calculates (SUM, AVG, etc.).
  <!---This should help you see why SUM of Capacity, Avg Bikes, etc. or ratios makes little sense. SUM of FAILUREs might make sense however!--->

### 6. Measure Names and Measure Values

<ul><li><a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/measure-names-and-measure-values">https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/measure-names-and-measure-values</a></li></ul>
<p>Automatically create fields that Tableau uses to help your analysis and visualization.
<em>Dual axis</em> is shown here and this allows you to show two measures on the same chart or map - very useful for data dense, relational graphics.
But you need to use <em>Measure Names</em> and <em>Measure Values</em> to produce even more data dense graphics that contain more than two data channels (measures) in the same chart.

### 7. Getting Started

<ul><li><a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started">https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started</a></li></ul>
<p>It's well worth running through the <em>Getting Started...</em> video series that we used in our introduction to Tableau once again to remind yourself what it can do and how it all works ...<br/>
<b>25 mins</b></p>

### 8. The Tableau Interface

<ul><li><a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/tableau-interface">https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/tableau-interface</a></li></ul>
<p>A short reminder of how Tableau gives you access to powerful functionality for visualization at the click of a button ... or two ... <br/>
