For the practical part of this week's class I'd like you to work on [Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=824741).

Please _explore the census data_ for the your LSOAs in your [Geographic Subset](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=898506).

Use _Tableau_ to explore the data and log possible _differences_, _features_ and _hypotheses_ as we did a couple of weeks ago with the LA (borough) data for London as a whole.

You should use _Tableau_ and our _Model of Visual Exploration and Visual Explanation_ (the _Exploration Spiral_) to engage with the data and stimulate ideas.

<div class="imgBox" style="float:center; align:center">
<img width=600  src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.week07.slides.explore.v1.png"/>
</div>

As you do so, be sure to record /  log suggested _differences_, _features_ and _hypotheses_  so that we can discuss them.

Use _annotations_,  make _duplicate_ copies of worksheets, combine worksheets in _dashboards_ or use the Tableau _story_ feature to log your findings.

Try to apply some of the approaches used in the [Tableau Dashboards & Narrative - Dashboard Design Tips & Tricks](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=902985) video as you develop your *records* and begin to produce *Visual Explanations*.

Remember to save copies of your workbook(s) regularly as a <code>TWBX</code>.

This *Record*ing of ideas will help you establish findings and select those that you wish to *Report*.
