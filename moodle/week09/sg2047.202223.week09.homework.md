### 1. **Week 09 - Videos**

I have added three videos to the [SG2047 Video Stream](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/137359a5-0076-4ced-beb7-eeee913f232e)

However, having recorded all of this, I discover that my mouse movement, which I was using to point the cursor at _this_ and _this_ on the screen, was not captured. _Sigh_.

I still think that these are useful descriptions that clarify important points.

I hope that watching through will be helpful in establishing concepts and providing inspiration as you explore and design data graphics, and increasingly think about design decisions, DNA and heurVIStics as you do so.

#### Part 1 : Location & Layout - 11 mins

I covered most of the ideas presented here in class, but it may be worth a re-cap.

I have released a recording because it didn't feel as though class went too well (bad room, lots of chatting, strange vibe, poor explanations).

If you want to see it again, or check things through - here's your chance!

#### Part 2 : Links & Levels - 30 mins

This is new stuff - please have a look.

Note that our postcode treemap of the geography of London _adds_ an encoding to the treemaps that were shown previously.
We show something useful with _position_

And that my inability to find EC1V 0HB shows that the postcode graphic _fails_ the DETECTION test.

Also, search around for good explanations of _TreeMaps_, which use containment to encode quantity and hierarchy concurrently.

Please _share_ these on the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=94494) forum.

#### Part 3 : Extra Exciting Examples

Some nice examples that show how we can use _containers_ and _connectors_ to show relationships (Tube Map) or represent these directly at different levels through a composite graphic (Matrix)that uses _location_ and _layout_ to relate pairs of individuals, and mini graphics with an encoding that shows how relationships between pairs of individuals vary over time (from bottom to top).

I do want you you think broadly about how you might design graphics to reveal structure in a range of data sets, and to apply some of your ideas to your efforts to visualize society.

### 2. **Coursework Task 2 - Visual Data Analysis**

Continue working with the [Census 2011 Key Variables for London LSOAs - Tableau Workbook](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2381691) as you explore society in the part of London that you have been assigned as your [Geographic Subset](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381690). You should be developing ideas for the [Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45842#section-21) assignment.

Remember that the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=94494) forum is the best place to discuss your ideas, findings and any _Tableau_ problems or solutions.
