A reminder of the things to do this week as you continue to work on [Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=14949#section-18).

&nbsp;

### 0. **Tableau Exploration - Lecture**

In class in week 09, I tried to show we might actually do some data _exploration_ in _Tableau Desktop_.

This involves checking the geographic and statistical distributions of variables, their relationships across geography and with each other, and trying to find and record (with annotations, composite dashboards, duplicate worksheets) trends and differences.

You can catch up with a [40 minute Lecture Capture](https://echo360.org.uk/media/70a84bee-159d-4011-bfe1-5689eecb7028/public) if you missed any or all of this.

 * [SG2047 Visualising Society Lecture 1 - Mar 26 2025 11:00AM](https://echo360.org.uk/media/70a84bee-159d-4011-bfe1-5689eecb7028/public)

Questions, comments, clarifications, fan mail and suggestions for words to use other than '_thing_' when I am trying to explain ... ummm ... things ... on the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=94494) forum please.

&nbsp;

### 1. **Tableau Tips - Video**

After all of this excitement, I didn't have time to demonstrate the _Tableau Dashboard Tips_ in class.

So be sure to watch the video that I have made available:

 * [Tableau Dashboards & Narrative - Dashboard Design Tips & Tricks](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=902985) 

This includes some important guidance on how to use _Tableau Desktop_ to complete the coursework.

 Feel free to discuss these ideas on the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=94494) forum.

### 2. **Coursework Task 2 - Practical Exercise+**

Keep working on your coursework.

The [Week 09 - Practical Exercise](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=902918) is designed to help with this, so please check in there and do as requested. 

##### IMPORTANT - Remember :

 - to read the [Coursework Instructions (PDF)](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1202209/mod_assign/introattachment/0/sg2047.coursework202425.task2.v10.pdf)  carefully - and comply with the various constraints!
 - to study the [rubric]() so that you understand the _criteria_ and what is expected for different levels of achievement (and marks)
 - to make sure that you understand the Key Statistics provided and what they mean - [Census 2021 - Key Variables for London - Explained](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824658)
 - that you can use any of the variables that you like - you are looking for patterns, structure, and relationships between places and their characteristics, and trying to show that you can use graphic to _find_ (Explore) and _communicate_ (Explain) these. 
 - that there is an opportunity to submit a structured draft submission this week so that you can get some feedback on your coursework as you make progress towards the submission date. See the [FEEDBACK (voluntary submission)](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=824745) assignment for details.

I am no longer discussing interpretations of the [Coursework Instructions (PDF)](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1202209/mod_assign/introattachment/0/sg2047.coursework202425.task2.v10.pdf) and will not comment further on these.

But I am pleased to provide guidance and comment on ideas relating to _Tableau_ and data visualization on the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=94494) forum, and hope that you will do the same.
