Make sure you have suitable [Annotation Tools](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824656) for annotating the slides and making notes as you learn.

The [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=824647) forum is a great place to share and discuss ideas, and ask and answer questions!

###### COMPLETION TIME: approx. 60 mins

#### 2. **READING LIST**

Find it, check the annotations, make sure you understand what is required and that you can access the materials.

Ask questions on the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=824647) forum.

###### COMPLETION TIME: approx. 45 mins

###### TASK 2 SUMMARY:

Complete the _[Task](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=824667)_ _Vis Activity_ where you use alternative visualization to complete tasks of different levels of complexity.

It gives you a good opportunity to think about what we can use visualization for and how different visualizations support and permit different types of task.

Check the _[Lecture Links](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824652)_ to see whether you want to follow up on any of the information presented during the lecture.

This is _non-essential_, but knowing that the links exist, and where they are if you need them, feels important at this stage. So I'd like you to at least click the link and see that there is some stuff there. You may want to cme back to it later.

Remember that the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=824647) forum is a great places to chat about any of this. Is there anything missing?

Note that the link that was broken during the lecture has been fixed - so you can now check _Santiago Ortiz's_ [45 Ways to Communicate Two Quantities
](https://web.archive.org/web/20220707134933/https://rockcontent.com/blog/45-ways-to-communicate-two-quantities/).

###### COMPLETION TIME: as long as you want!

###### TASK 6 SUMMARY:

> _Check the Lecture Links page so that you know how to access resources that were referenced or introduced during the lecture._
