The tasks should come as no surprise - they were introduced during the lecture this week üëâ.

Please complete **Task 3**, the [Visual Variable Estimation Task](https://cityunilondon.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6rodpArp96UmlZb) task, _by Monday morning_ so that I can have a look at the results before next week's class.

Remember to discuss any issues that arise, or ideas that you have in relation to these activities, to the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=2381582) forum.

### HOMEWORK

_This week's homework should take you about **3.5 hours** to complete ..._

### 1. **Complete This Week's Practical Exercise**

###### TIME: approx. 1 hr

Make sure you have completed the [Practical Exercise - Make a Data Graphic (Bikes & Tableau)](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2558256) that we started in class.

You should try using both data sets, experimenting with the two levels of spatial aggregation (resolution) for which we have data :

- [PostCode Areas](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2381629)
- [PostCode Districts](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2381630)

Please submit an annotated images to the [Make a Data Graphic (Bikes & Tableau)](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2558299) Submission Area, so that you can log progress and I can have a look at, and perhaps comment on, comment on your efforts to try to understand what is going on in the data set.

Consider this short video to help :

- [SG2047 - Week 04 - Averages, Aggregation and Sets](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/56401247-8f6e-4349-a9e1-12cf216dbd08)

I put it together to help explain how Tableau works in :

- _aggregating_ rows in a data set according to the level of _detail_ that you request;
- presenting these rows collectively using _numerical summaries_ that you select <code>SUM</code>, <code>AVG</code>, <code>MIN</code>, <code>CNT</code>, etc.

Be sure to use the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=2381582) forum to ask questions, raise issues, and talk about problems as you go.

##### TASK 1 SUMMARY:

> _Complete the **Practical Exercise** that we started in class and upload an image to the submission area ..._

&nbsp;

### 2. **CORE Reading**

###### TIME: approx. 1 hr

If you have not done so already, then now is the time to read the first section of [_The Big Book of Dashboards_](https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/535E9DE8-194F-A3E2-7490-341696F2265B.html).

I'd like you to do so before next week's class please in preparation for our session.<br/>
You can find the book, and details of what you need to read, on the _Module Reading List_:

- [Module Reading List](https://rl.talis.com/3/city/lists/4D152441-27AB-C0A5-5DAD-E23F65978349.html?lang=en)

It's all available online.<br/>
Please read _Part I_, which consists of _Chapter 1_ - _Data Visualization: A Primer_.

You should think about the examples, _take notes_ to help you understand the concepts and identify any issues that require clarification, discussion or further reading.

Please use [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=2381582) forum to raise issues, share thoughts and for discussion.

##### TASK 2 SUMMARY:

> _Read **Chapter 1** from **Part I** of the CORE module text - [*The Big Book of Dashboards*](https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/535E9DE8-194F-A3E2-7490-341696F2265B.html), and make good notes._

&nbsp;

### 3. **Estimation Task**

We will be thinking about the use of _Visual Variables_ for key visualization tasks next week.
One of these will be the estimation of **quantities** from visual different variables.

To get the hang of this, I would like you to have a go in advance.

Please spend _10 minutes_ or so completing the _short estimation task_ exercise:

- [Visual Variable Estimation Task](https://cityunilondon.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6rodpArp96UmlZb)

Yo do not have a **Prolific ID**, so when this is mentioned, just continue.

Have a think about what this experience might have taught you!<br/>
Do so, in particular, in light of the above reading.

This will prepare you nicely for the learning that we are doing next week.

##### TASK 3 SUMMARY:

> _Please complete the [Visual Variable Estimation Task](https://cityunilondon.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6rodpArp96UmlZb) before next week's session and have a think about how things went!_ <br/> _Did you learn anything?_

&nbsp;

### 4. **Tableau Videos**

###### TIME: approx. 1 hr

Much of the learning about _Tableau_ is down to you, and there are some really excellent online resources to help you with this.

I recommend a series of these on the [Tableau Training Videos](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381591) page, and strongly suggestthat you spend time this week on these videos to help you in your use of _Tableau_.

Please spend _about an hour_ studying the videos and trying the functionality in _Tableau_ :

- [Tableau Training Videos](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381591)

This will really support you in developing the _technical skills_ that you need in the module.

##### TASK 4 SUMMARY:

> _Spend time on the series of short but informative [Tableau Training Videos](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381591) to really help you get to grips with some of the key concepts that underpin Tableau!_

### ?. **Complete Outstanding Homework!**

It's down to you to make sure that you are up to date with everything.

Please use this important time at the start of term ensuring that you are up to date with all tasks.

##### EXTRA TASK ?:

> _Be sure to catch up with the homework tasks set so far and get yourself up to date._

> _**Coursework is set next week**._
