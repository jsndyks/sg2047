There are **NNNN** tasks this week - to consolidate on the learning that took place this week and prepare for next week.
You need to complete them _before Tuesday_ please.

### 1. **WEEK 02 VIDEOS - Extra Slides and Commentary**

###### TIME: approx. 60 mins

Before we get going on the homework, we need to finish the lecture!

I have produced videos describing the concepts (and slides and examples) that we didn't manage to get to this week.

Each is less than 20 minutes long. Please make sure you have watched through (and acted - making notes, checking WebSites) before the next class.

##### Annotation

Slides and commentary with example _DNA tables_ and an introduction to ways that we can capture '_ANNOTATION_' of marks associated with particular layers. These may _RELATE_ and _ASSOCIATE_ marks or be additional marks and labels that provide information to help interpret the encodings.

The video explains how to record annotation layers int he tables that we are producing.
Note that '_shade_' and '_area_' are interchangeable! ALso note that in some examples I am not using the _visual variables_ to describe encodings ... but you may be able to do so.

- [SG2047 - Week 02 - ANNOTATION](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/9932596b-f5a2-41e9-9193-0dd25ff28839)

##### Visual Variables

Introduces the set of _Visual Variables_ - the graphical characteristics of marks that we can vary in order to encode data. Make sure you know what they are and are able to use them in your DNA tables and other descriptions of graphics.

##### TASK 1 SUMMARY:

> _Watch the two **WEEK 02 Videos** on the new [SG2047 Video Stream](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/137359a5-0076-4ced-beb7-eeee913f232e)!_

#### 2. **Learn about COLOUR**

###### TIME: approx. 30 mins

Use [Colorizer](http://colorizer.org/) to make sure you understand how to describe colours using the **HSB**/**HSV** model.

Spend time with this changing the colours to see the effects.

You need to be able to differentiate between the ...

- **hue**
- **saturation**
- **lightness** / **brightness** / **value** (_all pretty much the same thing_)

... of a colour

This allows you to vary the three components of colour that _Jacques Bertin_ identified as **visual variables**.

Another useful example is [ImageColorPicker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en), which lets you upload URLs and then check the colours in images of the web pages.

This is a little fiddly, but worth a go as it means you can identify the three colour _visual variables_ : _HUE_, _SATURATION_ & _VALUE_ (or _lightness_) in online graphics, such as those in [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)

<img width="80%" style="padding-left:10%;padding-right:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/imagecolorpicker.hue.png" style="border:1px #bbb solid;"/>

##### TASK 2 SUMMARY:

> \_Learn about colour and use this knowledge to inform your DNA descriptions of the graphics we have been considering, such as:

- the [HIV/AIDS map](http://j.mp/worldHIVAIDSdeathRate2017)
- your selected graphic from Week 01
- your sketch of the bike stations data?

Can you develop DNA tables using the using these three components of colour that are _visual variables_?

---

#### 3. **Complete and Submit your SKETCH**

###### TIME: max. 30 mins

Please complete your sketches and make sure one of each pair submits them to the Week 02 submission area - [Make (and Describe) a Data Graphic](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2552844).

I'd also like you to try to create **a draft DNA table** that describes the encodings for _at least one LAYER_ in your sketch.

There are [DNA Templates](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2381609) here that may help.

You can add this as _online text_ when you make a submission, like this:

LAYER:
MARKS ARE - coloured dots
EACH REPRESENTS - times of day for different areas
DETAIL - hour, postcode area

DNA:
DATA - geography
RESOLUTION - postcode area
SHOWN WITH - hue

DATA - time
RESOLUTION - hour (selected, four per day)
SHOWN WITH - position (X axis)

DATA - average bikes available
RESOLUTION - high, 1 decimal place
SHOWN WITH - position (Y axis)

So, that would be a single _layer_ with a DNA table that contains three rows - I hope that's OK!

- remember to only use the _visual variables_ identified by Bertin, and tabulated by Roth
- see the sides and the [Visual Variables](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/55732f61-f864-45f6-bba9-75768cbee3ca) video for the list

To summarize: work together, please don't spend too long on the graphic - it is intended to be a* quick task*, and try to describe what you have done in a DNA table.

One of you will need to submit two things :

- an **IMAGE** - a high quality photo of the sketch
- some **ONLINE TEXT** - a DNA table for a LAYER that aims to describe a layer in your sketch in th manner shown above

Note that this sketch submission is _voluntary_ and _non-assessed_, but would be _useful_ for me (and I think it's useful for you!).

**IMPORTANT NOTE!**<br/>Try your best - there is nothing to lose here, but lots to gain.<br/>Consider the graphics in detail and come up with as good a _Layer_ and _Encoding_ or _DNA_ table as you can for each.<br/>
Your efforts will help me to help you learn.<br/>
**This is important learning and good practice for the first coursework task.**

##### TASK 3 SUMMARY:

> _Complete your sketch, produce **LAYOUT** and **DNA** tables that describe it, take a clear image of the sketch and then submit this and the DNA tables to the [Make (and Describe) a Data Graphic](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2552844) submission area._

> Bring the pencils that you have borrowed back to class next week as I need them for teaching the following day!

<!---

#### 3. **Watch a Couple of Short MOVIES**

I'd like you to watch a couple of short **movies** in which a couple of colleagues introduce some ideas about visualization.

_Jo Wood_ and _Miriah Meyer_ are two talented visualization researchers, both of whom I have written papers with recently, and they are two of the 3 chairs of the IEEE Information Visualization conference this time around.

They present some interesting ideas and examples that should help you see the kinds of work we do and ways that we design visual ways of presenting and interacting with data. I hope they are interesting introductions to visualization - particularly for _exploration_.

See the [Lecture Links](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1357970) page for links to the two short movies that I recommend.

##### TASK 3:

> _Watch the TEDx talks by **Jo Wood** and **Miriah Meyer**._

### 4. **Get Tableau Desktop**

###### TIME: max. 30 mins

Follow the _instructions on downloading and installing_ [Tableau Desktop](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381590)!

Also, make sure you have **registered** for _Tableau_ - you can do so by trying to access one of their educational videos such as [Getting Started](https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started).
There is no need to watch this _yet_, bu you should create an account.

<ul>
<li><code>Organization: City, University of London</code></li>
<li><code>Company Size: 201-10,000</code></li>
<li><code>Department: Other</code></li>
<li><code>Job Role: Student</code></li>
</ul>

We will be using _Tableau Desktop_ in the computer labs, but you may want to **download** and **install** a copy before next week's class, when we will be using _Tableau_ to explore some data and design some graphics.

##### TASK 4 SUMMARY:

> _Be sure to register for **Tableau**.<br/>Consider getting **Tableau Desktop** installed on your laptop or desktop computer if you have one._

---

#### 5. **Bring HEADPHONES to Class**

###### TIME: max. 15 mins

You will need **headphones** for next week.
Please make sure you have a pair and check that they work in the lab and with the lab computers before class!

##### TASK 5 SUMMARY:

> _Find and test some headphones - bring them to class next week._

---

We will be learning to use software next week - which should be good fun.

See you next week - do try to complete all of these homework and preparation tasks beforehand please!

Remember to use the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=94494) forum to share ideas, questions, answers, and generally discuss the various tasks and concepts.

Jason.
