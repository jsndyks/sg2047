There are **THREE** additional tasks this week:

- **one** is a **homework** task - this consolidates the learning that took place this week;
- **two** are **PREPARATION** tasks - to make sure you are ready for next week's class

You need to complete them _before the Week 03 lecture_ please.

### HOMEWORK

_Important things to do to consolidate this week's learning ..._

#### 1. **Learn about COLOUR**

###### TIME: approx. 30 mins

Use [Colorizer](http://colorizer.org/) to make sure you understand how to describe colours using the **HSB**/**HSV**/**HSL** model.

Spend time with this changing the colours to see the effects.

You need to be able to differentiate between the ...

- **hue**
- **saturation**
- **lightness** / **brightness** / **value** (_all pretty much the same thing_)

... of a colour

This allows you to vary the three components of colour that _Jacques Bertin_ identified as **visual variables**.

Another useful example is [ImageColorPicker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en), which lets you upload URLs and then check the colours in images of the web pages.

This is a little fiddly, but worth a go as it means you can identify the three colour _visual variables_ : _HUE_, _SATURATION_ & _VALUE_ (or _lightness_) in online graphics, such as those in [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)

<img width="60%" style="padding-left:10%;padding-right:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/imagecolorpicker.owid.png" style="border:1px #bbb solid;"/>

_Click a mark in a graphic, such as this one from Our World in Data ..._

<img width="60%" style="padding-left:10%;padding-right:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/imagecolorpicker.hue.png" style="border:1px #bbb solid;"/>

_... and see the colour components - Hue, Saturation and Lightness._

_Hue_ is usually recorded on a cyclical scale from 0-360, where 0 and 360 are red. Sometimes, it is recorded in the range 0-255.

_Saturation_ and _Lightness_ are often recorded on a linear scale from low to high, ranging from 0-100 or 0-255.

##### TASK 1 SUMMARY:

> _Learn about colour and use this knowledge to inform your DNA descriptions of the graphics we have been considering, such as:_
> - the [HIV/AIDS map](http://j.mp/worldHIVAIDSdeathRate2017)
> - your selected graphic from Week 01
> - other graphics introduced in the module so far
>
> _Can you develop DNA tables using the using these three components of colour that are important **visual variables**?_
<!-- > - your sketch of the bike stations data? -->

<!-- 
#### 3. **Complete and Submit your SKETCH**

###### TIME: max. 30 mins

Please complete your sketches and make sure one of each pair submits them to the Week 02 submission area - [Make (and Describe) a Data Graphic](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2552844).

I'd also like you to try to create **a draft DNA table** that describes the encodings for _at least one LAYER_ in your sketch.

There are [DNA Templates](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2381609) here that may help.

You can add this as _online text_ when you make a submission, like this:

<div style="margin-left:2em; font-size:80%; color:#606060">
LAYER:<br/>
MARKS ARE - coloured dots<br/>
EACH REPRESENTS - times of day for different areas<br/>
DETAIL - hour, postcode area<br/>
<br/>
DNA:<br/>
DATA - geography<br/>
RESOLUTION - postcode area<br/>
SHOWN WITH - hue<br/>
<br/>
DATA - time<br/>
RESOLUTION - hour (selected, four per day)<br/>
SHOWN WITH - position (X axis)<br/>
<br/>
DATA - average bikes available<br/>
RESOLUTION - high, 1 decimal place<br/>
SHOWN WITH - position (Y axis)<br/>
</div>

<br/>So, that would be a single _layer_ with a DNA table that contains three rows - I hope that's OK!

- remember to only use the _visual variables_ identified by Bertin, and tabulated by Roth
- see the sides and the [Visual Variables](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/55732f61-f864-45f6-bba9-75768cbee3ca) video for the list

To summarize:

- work together
- please don't spend too long on the graphic - it is intended to be a* quick task*, and
- try to describe what you have done in a best-guess DNA table.

One of you will need to submit two things :

- an **IMAGE** - a high quality photo of the sketch
- some **ONLINE TEXT** - a DNA table for a LAYER that aims to describe a layer in your sketch in the manner shown above

Note that this sketch submission is _voluntary_ and _non-assessed_, but would be _useful_ for me (and I think it's useful for you!).

**IMPORTANT NOTE!**<br/>Try your best - there is nothing to lose here, but lots to gain.<br/>Consider the graphics in detail and come up with as good a _Layer_ and _Encoding_ or _DNA_ table as you can for each.<br/>
Your efforts will help me to help you learn.<br/>
**This is important learning and good practice for the first coursework task.**

##### TASK 3 SUMMARY:

> _Complete your sketch, produce **LAYOUT** and **DNA** tables that describe it, take a clear image of the sketch and then submit this and the DNA tables to the [Make (and Describe) a Data Graphic](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2552844) submission area._

> _Bring the pencils that you have borrowed back to class next week as I need them for teaching the following day!_

#### 3. **Watch a Couple of Short MOVIES**

I'd like you to watch a couple of short **movies** in which a couple of colleagues introduce some ideas about visualization.

_Jo Wood_ and _Miriah Meyer_ are two talented visualization researchers, both of whom I have written papers with recently, and they are two of the 3 chairs of the IEEE Information Visualization conference this time around.

They present some interesting ideas and examples that should help you see the kinds of work we do and ways that we design visual ways of presenting and interacting with data. I hope they are interesting introductions to visualization - particularly for _exploration_.

See the [Lecture Links](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1357970) page for links to the two short movies that I recommend.

##### TASK 3:

> _Watch the TEDx talks by **Jo Wood** and **Miriah Meyer**._

--->

### PREPARATION

_I reckon you have about **45 mins** of preparation to do for next week ..._

---

#### 2. **Get Tableau Desktop**

###### TIME: max. 30 mins

Follow the _instructions on downloading and installing_ [Tableau Desktop](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824653)!

Also, make sure you have **registered** for _Tableau_ - you can do so by trying to access one of their educational videos such as [Getting Started](https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started).
There is no need to watch this _yet_, but you should create an account. I suggest ...

<ul>
<li><code>Organization: City, University of London</code></li>
<li><code>Company Size: 201-10,000</code></li>
<li><code>Department: Other</code></li>
<li><code>Job Role: Student</code></li>
</ul>

We will be using _Tableau Desktop_ in the computer labs, but you may want to **download** and **install** a copy on your own computer before next week's class, when we will be using _Tableau_ to explore some data and design some graphics.

##### TASK 2 SUMMARY:

> _Be sure to register for **Tableau**.<br/>Consider getting **Tableau Desktop** installed on your own laptop or desktop computer if you have one._

---

#### 3. **Bring HEADPHONES to Class Next Week**

###### TIME: max. 15 mins

You will need **headphones** for next week.

Please make sure you have a pair and _check that they work in the lab and with the lab computers_ before attending class!

##### TASK 3 SUMMARY:

> _Find and test some headphones - and make sure you bring them to class next week._

---

OK - that's it!

We will be learning to use software next week - which should be good fun.

See you next week - do try to complete all of these homework and preparation tasks beforehand please!

Remember to use the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=824647) forum to share ideas, questions, answers, suggestions and generally discuss the various tasks and concepts.
