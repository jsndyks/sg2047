This week will be self-guided - <b>no teacher, no class</b>, though <b>D518</b> is available at the scheduled time should you wish to use it (nice room!).

I have produced videos and materials to structure and support your learning.

This page introduced them and lets you know what you need to do!

Please _follow the instructions_ and use the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=824647) forum to discuss any issues that arise.

<!-- ---

There are **XXX** tasks this week:

- **three** are **homework** that consolidate on the learning that took place this week,
- **two** are **PREPARATION** - to make sure you are ready for next week's class -->

You need to complete the task _before Wednesday of Week 03_ please - the sooner the better.

### LECTURE

_This week's lecture should take you about **2 hours** to complete ..._

_Be sure to have a break and reward yourself with something motivating after completing each video!_

#### **TASK : LEARN FROM THE WEEK 02 VIDEOS**

###### TIME: approx. 120 mins

I have produced **FIVE** videos describing the concepts (and slides and examples) that I would have introduced in class had I been available.

They are all listed in on the _Module Homepage_ in this week's section:

 * [Week 02 - 05 Feb - DESCRIBING DATA GRAPHICS](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=14949#section-6).



Do watch them in order, take notes, try things out, identify questions, and post and discuss reactions on the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=824647) forum.

A single PDF contains the [Week 02 - Slides](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=824668) that should help you with your learning: take notes, jot down ideas and interpretations, identify things that you don't understand, things that you need to find out, things that I explain poorly, questions that you have.

##### >> [Reading a Data Graphic](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=880745) (1/5)

**20 min video** - discusses the way to begin reading a data graphic in a structured manner by asking four related questions - with examples:

 1. (Can I) Identify sets of marks that vary in similar ways (layers)?; 
 2. How many layers (and marks per layer) are there?; 
 3. What do the marks represent? (what are they?); 
 4. Which visual characteristics vary to shown data?; 

##### >> [Find a Data Graphic (Feedback)](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=880748) (2/5)

**10 min video** - some feedback on the _[Find a Graphic](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824665)_ practical exercise.

Feedback (and discussion) on some of the _FACTS_ and _RELATIONSHIPS_ identified by students in examples selected from _[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)_.

##### >> [Describing Data Graphics](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=880744) (3/5)

**53 min video** - the main content of this week's 'lecture' introduces key concepts in _Describing Data Graphics_.

How to produce a DNA table - examples and discussion around what we might do to describe a data graphic through a structured process in a structured manner that involves _Layer_, _DNA_ and _Annotation_ tables.  

Annotate the [Week 02 - Slides](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=824668) as you use the video.
Remember to use the play, pause and rewind buttons as you watch.<br/>

##### >> [Annotation](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=880760) (4/5)

**18 min video** on _Annotation Tables_

_DNA Table Annotation_ explained with examples.

##### >> [Visual Variables](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=880763) (5/5)

**20 min video** on _Visual Variables_.

_Visual Variables_ explained. These are a limited / closed set of _visual characteristics_ that we can vary in the marks that we produce to visually represent data.

We use them to describe **encodings** - _a relationship between data variation and visual variation_ that is key to our efforts to visualize information - in DNA tables.


<!--
Slides and commentary with example _DNA tables_ and an introduction to ways that we can capture '_ANNOTATION_' of marks associated with particular layers. These may _RELATE_ and _ASSOCIATE_ marks or be additional marks and labels that provide information to help interpret the encodings.

The video explains how to record annotation layers in the tables that we are producing.
Note that '_shade_' and '_area_' are interchangeable! Also note that in some examples I am not using the _visual variables_ to describe encodings ... but you may be able to do so.

##### Visual Variables

Introduces the set of _Visual Variables_ - the graphical characteristics of marks that we can vary in order to encode data. Make sure you know what they are and are able to use them in your DNA tables and other descriptions of graphics.
