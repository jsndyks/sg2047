Hello!

The second half of **Visualizing Society**  starts this week ... and the work you have done to learn _Tableau Desktop_ will be super important here.

Make sure you have completed all of the _Tableau_ exercises before Wednesday as we will be using _Tableau_ in class.

These are documented on Moodle - check the [Week 04 - Homework](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824688) for a reminder.

I have updated the [Module Timeline](https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/roadMap/sg2047.plan.202425.roadMap.png) to show progress too ... make sure you are on track!

See you in class, ready to learn, at 11am.

**Jason**
