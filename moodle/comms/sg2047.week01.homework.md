Hello!

I was asked about using the PDFs to take notes, and how you might go about doing this.<br/>
Here are _a few ideas_ that might get you started.<br/>

- [Annotation Tools](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2550574)

Take time to explore the options and use them well - these will be essential to your studies.

Also, a reminder that **before next Tuesday** you need to ...

Check through:

1. the [Introduction](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45842#section-1) section
2. the [Communication](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45842) section
3. and then familiarise yourself with the [Reading List](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2381588)

Then you should complete the Week 01 practical work, which requires you to:

1. [Find a Graphic](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381602)
2. Report what you have found through the [Find a Graphic - Reporting](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2381603)<br/>
   _8 of you have done so already, which is great!_
3. Try the [Data Visualization Task Test](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2381604)<br/>
   _5 of you have done so already, which is a good start!_

Do discuss issues that arise in the [Visualization Discussion Forum](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=94494)

Jason.
