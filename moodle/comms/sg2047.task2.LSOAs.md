OK, check the BOROUGHS section here, which should clarify:
https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824707

I'm not after bars for each LSOA, you have hundreds of these, just comparisons that are at more detailed level than 'Borough'.
So basically, don't aggregate. Do your analysis on the LSOAs.

I'm looking for insights and observations that are embrace the detail of the LSOA-based data set like:

> "LSOAs with large proportions of students are clustered in the SouthWest and South East"

... and of course some other interesting things that happen in the same or different places show how the aspects of society for which we have data relate.

Rather than:

> "Haringey and Waltham Forest have more students than Enfield"
