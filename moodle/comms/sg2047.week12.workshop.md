You will see some new activity for Visualizing Society this week.

There is a Moodle block for Week 12:

This includes:

- some answers to questions that I have been asked recently
- times and dates for three 1-hour Coursework Workshops this week

Please have a look and spread the word.

**IMPORTANT: Change of plan.**

I have had a tough couple of days and am resting up again as the COVID chaos continues.
So I am on my back and dosing up on meds, liquids and lemon and trying to recover for the rest of the week.
I need to get better.

I'll try to set up an online workshop early next week and hope to be back on the discussion boards then too.
Watch this space.

In the mean time ...

Remember - you have plenty of information and materials that will help you do well.

Spend time reading the [Coursework Brief](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3030288/mod_assign/introattachment/0/sg2047.coursework2023.task2.v1.pdf?forcedownload=1) carefully.

Then please engage with the following, which provide plenty of guidance to help you do well :

- [the outcomes](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381578) - these tell you what you need to show me
- [the rubric](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2541440) - this tells you how to do well - click 'Add Submission'
- [the HeurVIStics](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2381648) - simple tests that give you a framing for you explanations
- [the Design Guidelines](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2381642) - rules and rankings for encodings
- [the Big Book of Dashboards](https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/535E9DE8-194F-A3E2-7490-341696F2265B.html?lang=en) - this contains theory (Part I) and examples (Part II) that can inform your efforts
- [the Tableau tutorials](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381591) - how do do all of this with the software

And of course, the lecture notes and videos.
The deeper the engagement, better.

Your job is to understand all of this, think it through, link it together and apply it to the task in hand.<br/>
And from what I see, there's lots of evidence that you are doing this pretty well.

My job is to rest up and recover so I'm fit to mark your work!
