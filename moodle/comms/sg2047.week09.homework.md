Hello,

I have put together a [Week 09 - Homework](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=905047) page to remind you of the things that you need to prioritise before class this week.

_They should not surprise you_, but there is a reminder that you have an opportunity to submit a structured draft submission at then end of this week so that you can get some feedback on your coursework as you make progress towards the submission date.

See the [FEEDBACK (voluntary submission)](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=824745) assignment for details.

It is a voluntary submission that is intended to give :
 - _you_ some motivation to get going
 - _you_ practice at using the submission area
 - _you_ some limited individual feedback on your progress and intentions
 - _me_ some indication as to how things are going
 - _me_ a reasonable workload
 - _all of us_ some reassurance that things are going OK

Fingers crossed!

Best!

Enjoy the sunshine ☀️.

Jason.
