<p>Hello.</p>

<p>Thanks for attending SG2047 yesterday</p>

<ul>
<li>23 of you were on time - which is pretty good.</li>
<li>23 were not - this is frustrating for everybody</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a PostIt pie chart.</p>

<p>Please could you encourage all of your colleagues to be on time ready to learn at 11am next week?
<br/>Great!
<br/>We want a bigger smiley slice of pie please and a smaller frowny piece.</p>

<p>I have added a page that describes the _[Homework](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=879456)_ that you need to complete to be ready for next week's class.</p>

<p>There are a few things to do so please plan this and get on with it, using the discussion board to raise any issues, log any ideas and discuss the activities.</p>

<p>Oh, and I found an archived version of Santiago Ortiz's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220707134933/https://rockcontent.com/blog/45-ways-to-communicate-two-quantities/">45 Ways to Communicate Two Quantities</a> activity, so you can check some solutions there now too if you are interested.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Hello again!</p>

<p>A couple of you have asked if you can upload <em>Word</em> documents in response to the Week 01 - <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824665">Find a Graphic</a></p>

<p>The short answer is <b>No Thanks!</b>. I'd like you to use <em>Online Text</em>, which you just type (or paste) into the text box in the submission area.</p>

<p>There are reasons for this ...</p>
<ul>
    <li>I want to minimise the size of the task - it's supposed to be a quick effort;</li>
    <li>I get a very readable summary when everybody submits in this way - so it's efficient for me to mark and an efficient way for you to get quick feedback;</li>
    <li>You will be using this method of submission later in the module - so it's good practice;</li>
</ul>
<p>So please stick to the instructions.</p>
<p>I also found a short video (5 mins) that covers the two tasks (I have set them before, they work pretty well) so I have added this to the module <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/local/kalturamediagallery/index.php?courseid=14949">Media Gallery</a>, which will grow as we move through the module.<br/>Know that ...</p>
<p style="margin-left:4em;color:#666"><em>This video is a couple of years old, the sound is dodgy and some of the terminology is slightly different - but these are the same exercises and so the explanation is valid and may be helpful.</em>
</p>
<p>Do have a look if you have not completed the tasks yet - if you have done, fine, congratulations the 9 who have done so, on being so organised and ahead of the game!</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Jason.</p>
