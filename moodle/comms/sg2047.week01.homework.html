<p>Hello.</p>

<p>Thanks for attending SG2047 yesterday</p>

<ul>
<li>23 of you were on time - which is pretty good.</li>
<li>23 were not - this is frustrating for everybody</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a PostIt pie chart.</p>

<p>Please could you encourage all of your colleagues to be on time ready to learn at 11am next week?
<br/>Great!
<br/>We want a bigger smiley slice of pie please and a smaller frowny piece.</p>

<p>I have added a page that describes the _[Homework](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=879456)_ that you need to complete to be ready for next week's class.</p>

<p>There are a few things to do so please plan this and get on with it, using the discussion board to raise any issues, log any ideas and discuss the activities.</p>

<p>Oh, and I found an archived version of Santiago Ortiz's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220707134933/https://rockcontent.com/blog/45-ways-to-communicate-two-quantities/">45 Ways to Communicate Two Quantities</a> activity, so you can check some solutions there now too if you are interested.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Jason.</p>
