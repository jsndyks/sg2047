<p>Hello!</p>

<p>Unavoidable unforeseen circumstances mean that <b>I will not be in the University to teach as scheduled on Weds 5th February</b>.</p>

<p>So <b>there will be no class in D518 at 11:00 this week</b>.</p>

<p>This is a shame, I enjoyed last week.</p>

<p>I have, however, produced videos and learning materials that you should use in lieu of the cancelled lecture.</p>

<p>See here: [Week 02 - 05 Feb - DESCRIBING DATA GRAPHICS](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=14949#section-6)</p>

<p>And the room should be free if you want to use it - nice space!</p>

<p>There is plenty to do before next Wednesday!<br/>Please get the work done as soon as you are able.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you then.</p>

<p>Jason.</p>

<p>P.S. - The videos should be online from 9am tomorrow.</p>
