After a couple of discussions, I wanted to try to clarify and explain _colour models_ and how we can use them to detect variation in the _visual variables_ that are used to encode in data graphics ... and to emphasize the guidance that I offered in class.

 * [Colour Schemes and Visual Variables](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=824702)

I explain in this page, and reiterate that ordinarily we would use a _single colour model_ to describe the colours in a graphic - <b>HSL</b> or <b>HSV</b>. 

But it does seem to me that it helps us detect variations in these colour components in meaningful ways if we ...</p>

 * use <b>HSL</b> to detect and record differences in <b>lightness</b> across a colour scheme and in a data graphic
 * use <b>HSV</b> to detect and record differences in <b>saturation</b> across a colour scheme and in a data graphic

So that is my recommendation - if you use the <a href="https://pinetools.com/image-color-picker">PineTools : Online Image Color Picker</a> to do so, this will give you a good sense of how these colour components vary as colour is applied to data graphics.

Jason.
