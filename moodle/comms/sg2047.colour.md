### Colour Schemes and Visual Variables

_An example colour scheme and its description using Visual Variables ..._

#### 1. ColorBrewer

Let's consider a [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=YlOrRd&n=7) sequential scheme, that works well for _numeric_ or _ordinal_ data ... data with a _sequence_.

<div style="align:center">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/colorBrewer.YlOrRd.7.png" style="width:300px; padding:0.5em; border:1px solid #e0e0e0"/>
</div>

The numbers here are the _Red_, _Green_ and _Blue_ components of the colour, all on a scale of 0-255. Colours are often defined in this way. But we need to define and describe them using the differentiable _visual variables_ the _Hue_, _Saturation_ and _Lightness_ that combine to uniquely describe any colour, all colours.

#### 2. ImageColorPicker

We can find the _Hue_, _Saturation_ and _Lightness_ of the colours in an image with various tools, apps, websites and plugins.

I suggest [ImageColorPicker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) where you can select an image for analysis by _browsing_ your file space or _dragging and dropping_ an image into the web browser.

This allows you to analyse screen dumps. You can also specify images by URL and check them that way.

#### 3. Colour Visual Variables

Here is what I get when I check the 7 colours from the image of the [ColorBrewer YlOrRd](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=YlOrRd&n=7) seven class scheme shown above - I screen dumped this.

##### HUE

Remember that **Hue** is usually a number between 0 and 360. We can represent these as angles round a colour wheel, from 0 at the top (a red hue) round the rainbow and back to 359.

Here is a wheel showing the seven hues for the [ColorBrewer YlOrRd](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=YlOrRd&n=7) seven class scheme and their angles and positions on a colour wheel.

<div style="align:center">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.colorWheel.num.png" style="width:300px; padding:0.5em; border:1px solid #e0e0e0"/>
</div>

So **347** is just 13 Hue points past zero!

What this shows is a _gentle hue progression_, in sequence from _Yellow_ to _Orange_ to _Red_ ... hence the name of the scheme.

So _Hue_ does vary a little in this scheme. It does so sequentially, so we can detect the order.

##### LIGHTNESS

We can think of _value_ and _lightness_ and _luminance_ and _brightness_ as the same thing at this stage. You will see _HSL_ and _HSV_ and _HSB_ descriptions of colour, and they do vary. But for now, let's consider the _lightness_ numbers that I recorded above.

How do they vary across the scheme?

Well, let's create a graph!
The colours in the [ColorBrewer YlOrRd](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=YlOrRd&n=7) seven class scheme go from left (1, light yellow) to right (7, dark red) here.

<div style="align:center">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.colorSatVal.png" style="width:500px; padding:0.5em; border:1px solid #e0e0e0"/>
</div>

We can see that _value_ or _brightness_ or _lightness_ decreases in order across the scheme, from mid 80s to mid 30s.

So lightness and hue both vary consistently and sequentially in this scheme to give it a _visual order_.
Those are two consistent encodings used in a single scheme, and probably both used in any graphic in which it is employed to encode the same data channel.

##### SATURATION

How about _saturation_ - the _richness_ or _chroma_ of a colour that varies from high values that are highly saturated to low values that are pastel and washed out.

Well the graph ðŸ‘† shows little consistent variation. These are fully _saturated_ colours with just one (slightly strange, seemingly inconsistent) variation.

So I don't think that _saturation_ is being used to encode here - it hardly varies.

Here is the [ColorBrewer YlOrRd](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=YlOrRd&n=7) seven class scheme.

<div style="align:center">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.colorScheme.sat.98.png" style="width:500px; padding:0.5em; border:1px solid #e0e0e0"/>
</div>

The **top row** defines colours with the original values for _Hue_, _Lightness_ and _Saturation_.

The **bottom row** shows the same _Hue_, and _Lightness_ as in the original, but keeps _Saturation_ constant at 98%. The only perceptible difference is for class 6 where the dark hue seems to stand out and the sequence from class 5 to class 7 does not seem constant. This probably explains why cartographers, like _Cindy brewer_ adjust colour schemes so that they vary in ways that we perceive to be continuous, even if this results in some discontinuities in the way that the visual variables of colour are applied.

Just to show what variation in saturation looks like, here is the original scheme again in the _middle\_\_ row.
The two rows either side of this take the \_first_ (top) and _final_ (bottom) colour in the sequence and vary the _saturation_ while keeping _hue_ and _lightness_ constant.

<div style="align:center">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.colorScheme.sat.varies.png" style="width:500px; padding:0.5em; border:1px solid #e0e0e0"/>
</div>

This should help you see the effects of varying the _saturation_ of a single colour.
