OK,

let's meet at **11am on Tuesday 11:00 - 12:30**, we will be in **EG02**.

**Please come prepared.**

To help me give you useful feedback you should work on your dashboard and commentary in advance and

- select TWO of the Design Tests for Data Visualization and explain whether they have been achieved in your graphics.<br/>
  I will expect you to explain **how** - if the tests are passed - and **why** not - if they are failed.

- think of TWO specific questions that you would like feedback on.<br/>I will try my best to give you help
  in answering them in the workshop.

See you on Tuesday.

Jason.
