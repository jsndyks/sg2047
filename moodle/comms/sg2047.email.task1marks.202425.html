Hello.

I have released *provisional* marks for SG2047 Task 1 today.

These are indicative marks - subject to moderation, consideration by the Assessment board and approval by Senate.

You can find everything on Moodle - check the 'Grader' section.

I have added comments to the submissions in most cases so please open the submission up and have a look - I think you need to click a blue icon that looks like a pencil, but have a play around!
Check the RUBRIC for your scores for the three different criteria.

On the whole the work is very good and shows plenty of learning, capability and talent. This is encouraging and pretty impressive. On occasion the standard is excellent. Very well done if your scores are in the 70s or above. If your score is below 40% then do try to connect with me to discuss your progress. We should chat about your work and I will work with you to help you understand concepts and to identify strategies that you can take to improve your work. The best way to do this 1:1 is through Teams - please send me a chat message.

Remember that the marks are provisional and subject to change by the moderator and the examiners as we go through our quality processes before, during (and on rare occasions after) the exam board in June. So, IMPORTANTLY, nobody has passed or failed anything yet and you need to take no specific action based upon these provisional marks.

But please do listen to the individual feedback and act on this to improve your knowledge and chances of doing well as the module moves forwards. That's the point really - this is a diagnostic test that gives you some individual feedback on how I think you are doing at this stage. This should inform your ongoing efforts in the module. I'll provide some general feedback on Task 1 and set the second piece of coursework (Task 2) in class during week 08.

Do be in the classroom on time so that we can get on with things.

See you then.

Until then, keep working on the homework - playing with Tableau to explore the Census data.
This will serve you well in preparation for Task 2.

Jason.
