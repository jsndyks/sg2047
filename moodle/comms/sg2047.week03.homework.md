There are **FOUR** tasks this week, and they are significant ones.<br/>
Two of them are activities that you have already been asked to complete (see slides).

All of them are things that need doing **before the Week 04 class**.

One is an extra video to cover some slides and concepts that I didn't have time for in class.

And there is an opportunity to _describe_ and _upload_ your '_Bikes &amp; Crayons_' sketch  ... and _a chance_ that I will find time to give you some feedback!<br/>Here's hoping.

Everything is described here:

 * [Week 03 - Homework](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824680)

But, _in summary_ ...

1. complete the **[Video - DNA Tables Colour](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=885535)** and use the Visualization Discussion forum to communicate about it as you consolidate your learning; <br/>

2. work through on the **[Practical Exercise : Tableau - Getting Started](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824676)** exercise, watching all of the videos and completing the demos with Tableau, finishing this off in your own time before next week's class; <br/>

3. finish the graphic that you produced in the **[Practical Exercise - Make a Data Graphic (Bikes & Crayons)](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=824669)**, take a decent photo, upload it and see whether you can add a DNA Table that explains one or more of the encodings you came up with; <br/>

4. use the **[DNA Tables - Examples & Explanations](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=824675)** document to consolidate the ideas about DNA tables and create / update your own. <br/>

Sorry this page has come online a little late - _it's been a busy week!_ <br/>
But the tasks are the same as those shown in the slides and flagged at the end of the lecture - so no surprises.<br/>

**You need to complete them _before the Week 04 class_ please.**

See you there and on the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=824647) forum.
