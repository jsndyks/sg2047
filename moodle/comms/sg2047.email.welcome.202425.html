<p>Hello [:firstname:],<br/><br/></p>

<p>I'm leading the <em>Visualizing Society</em> module this term and understand that you'll be taking the course (SG2047).<br/><br/></p>

<p>It should be fun - there is plenty to learn and we have some good software, interesting data sets and rich resources lined up.<br/><br/></p>

<p>These will help us learn about visualization and visualize some data.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Before we start, I would like you to look at the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=14949">Moodle Homepage</a>. Have a look at our plan for the term by considering the <em>RoadMap</em> and opening the various blocks and reading through the module structure.<br/><br/></p>

<p>I'd like you to do a little preparation for the class on Wednesday too. Could you check the <em>Introduction & Preparation</em> and <em>Communication</em> sections on the Moodle homepage?<br/><br/></p>

<p>It's important that you familiarise yourself with the key documents before the module begins.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Also, please have a look at the <em>Reading List</em>, so you get a sense of the materials that I think you'll need to consult to help you learn this term. I have listed and described the ESSENTIAL reading and the RECOMMENDED reading.
</p>
<ul>
<li>ESSENTIAL - you all need to read this during the term - it's essential!</li>
<li>RECOMMENDED - this will really help you understand and use the concepts that we learn about in the module and give you explanations, examples and a depth of knowledge that I can't provide in our relatively limited time together. Use this to do well in Visualizing Society.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do check the <em>Reading List</em> through and make sure you understand the importance of and know how to access the resources.<br/><br/></p>

<p>I'll produce and use slides each week that summarise some of the key concepts that I introduce. These give you some structure upon which to make notes that explain your interpretations and remind you of where you need to find out more! Copies of slides used in the first lecture will be made available on the day. You'll get a PDF for download from Moodle and I recommend annotating the notes digitally. See the Annotation Tools page for some ideas on how to make use of them.<br/><br/></p>

<p>IMPORTANTLY - Please arrive in good time - be ready to learn at 11am. Students who arrive late disrupt staff and fellow students, so I'd ask you to respect me and your colleagues by being on time and ready to learn as the class starts - and throughout the session!<br/><br/></p>

<p>Obviously there are some occasions when it's not possible to be on time, but please make sure that this is never down to your lack of planning. I'll see you in <b>D518</b> at <b>11am</b> on <b>Wednesday 29th</b> - having prepared as requested please!<br/><br/></p>

<p>Thanks.<br/><br/></p>
