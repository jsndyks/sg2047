Hello [:firstname:]

Sorry for the terrible formatting of these messages - I am trying my best!

I understand that you have an extension for Task 2.

I'd like to run a workshop in which we can discuss your progress 1-to-1 and I can
provide some feedback as you develop your submission.

Given other commitments, the earliest I can schedule this is ...

- **11:00-12:30 on Tuesday 2nd May**.

I will book a room and likely split this into three half-hour sessions, giving each of you **ten minutes** to show me your work and for us to discuss it one-to-one.

More details later, but for now ...

- **can you tell me whether this would be useful and whether you would attend?**

This will help with my planning.

Be sure to use the discussion forum to raise and discuss issues in the meantime.

Cheers.

Jason.
