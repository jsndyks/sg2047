<p>Hello!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=14949#courseindexcollapse8">Week 05 - Slides</a> are now online so you can access them ahead of class.</p>

<p>We will be making more <i>Data Graphics</i> this week, but using <i>Tableau</i> rather than pens and paper.</p>

<p>So please make sure that you have completed the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824680">Week 03 Homework</a> in which you complete a <i>Tableau Tutorial</i> before attending coming to class tomorrow.</p>

<p>If you have not completed the <i>Tableau Tutorial</i> then please come along and do it in class, but know that you are behind where I expect you to be.<br/>
    The first assignment is set next week (week 05) with a quick turnaround.<br/>
    So please figure out a way of catching up.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p><b>Jason.</b></p>
