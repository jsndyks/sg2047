Hello,

I have made the **Week 10** materials available this afternoon - we focus on _Dashboards_ this week.

I have put together a short [Week 10 - What is a Dashboard](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824723) page to try to unpick the different ways in which the term is used.

Then there is a 40 minutes [Week 10 - Video Lecture](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=905582) in which I introduce key concepts. I'd like you to watch this.

There are the usual 4-per-page [Week 10 - Slides](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=905595) to go with this: make notes, log questions, identify actions as you run through the lecture.

I'd like you to complete the [Week 10 - Practical Exercise](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824724), which will take about an hour, in your own time.

In class (Weds, 11am, **EGL05**) I'll introduce some of the concepts in the lecture.

We will then head to **EG03** at 12 to use _Tableau_ to make progress on the coursework because you have the chance to submit a [Voluntary Feedback Submission](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=824745) at the end of the week. So it would be good to make some progress.

Please get on with your EXPLORATION, recording and preliminary EXPLANATION in **EG03** and ...

 * show me what you are up to
 * come armed with challenging questions and interesting ideas 

Cheers.

Jason.
