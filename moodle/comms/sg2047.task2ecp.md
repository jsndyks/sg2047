Hello [:studentname:]

I understand that you have an extension for Task 2.

I'd like to run a class in which we can discuss your progress and I can provide feedback.

Given other commitments, the earliest I can schedule this is 11:00-12:30 on Tuesday.
I will book a room and likely split this into three half-hour sessions, giving each of you ten minutes to show me your work and for us to discuss it.

More details later, but for now, can you tell me whether this would be useful and whether you would attend?
This will help with my planning.

Be sure to use the discussion forum to raise and discuss issues in the meantime.

Cheers.

Jason.
