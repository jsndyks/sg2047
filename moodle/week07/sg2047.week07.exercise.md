### Week 07 : Tableau Practical - Exploring the Census

We will be exploring data about society in London as measured through the UK Census of Population this week. We will be using _Tableau_ to do so.

#### What You Need To Do ...

You'll need to spend time working with this visualization software during this week's class and independently in your own time to achieve the following objectives and outputs.

##### Objectives - The Point

The key objectives are for you to use the time in class and subsequently to ensure that you :

- [ ] are able to **download** the Census 2021 Data for _London Boroughs_ and visualize these data in Tableau;
- [ ] understand the **structure** and **composition** of the Census 2021 Data - you need to know what it means;
- [ ] can **visualize** the data _effectively_ using some of what you have learned in the first half of the module about _encoding_, _levels of measurement_, _guidance_ and the design _HeurVIStics_;
- [ ] are able to **explore** the data through interactive visualization;

Make sure you can do these things - you should practice them, try things out, experiment. Be bold in your use of the software, design ideas and exploration of the data.

##### What Am I Looking For ...?

As you explore the data you will need to find and document (record, write-down, annotate ...) :

- **differences** - between places, variables, etc;

- **interesting features** - that you see in the data ...

  - something you knew already?
  - something you didn't know?
  - something about where you live?

- **questions** or **hypotheses** ...
  - about the data
  - about society in London
  - what kind of questions or hypotheses does your visual exploration of these data give rise to?

**Please note down examples of each - once you have these, you have completed the exercise!**

##### How Do I Do That Then ...?

Experiment! Play! Be Bold! Try Things Out!<br/>
(_And use the 'Back' button when things inevitably go a bit crazy_)


The exploration process might be informed by our informal model (shown below).
Hopefully you will find yourself moving around it as you detect items and patterns of interest.

_Here's a bigger copy of this diagram of the processes of [Visual Exploration and Visual Explanation](https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.week07.slides.explore.v1.png)_.

This activity should take you something in the region of 2-3 hours - but you may need to spend more time than this experimenting with the various capabilities in the software and learning how to use it. This will certainly be time well spent.

**You should start the exercise in class and must complete the work before we meet again next week.**

##### Where Do I Start ...?

Check the 4 minute video on [**Exploring the Census with Tableau**](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=896182) for a quick introduction to ways in which you can ENCODE the Census data in Tableau and RELATE encodings by linking them with common associative properties.<br/>
This approach is called BRUSHING and will help you look for relationships, patterns and differences in the Census data.

#### Data

In this exercise we'll be focusing on a data set containing key statistics from the _2021 UK Census of Population for London_.

These data are _collected_ at household level and capture important information about society. For this exercise we have _aggregated_ the data to Local Authority level. So the information for each Local Authority is the sum of all the information for each of the households that are within it. This is the _resolution_ at which we are working here. In London, local authorities relate to the familiar Boroughs :

- Islington, Camden, Brent, Barnet, Westminster, Hackney, Tower Hamlets, etc.

Download the following files and open them up _to get a sense of what our data look like, and what they mean_ ...

- [Census 2021 - Key Variables for London - Explained - WEB](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824658)<br/>
  _The key census variables are described in full in this scrollable **Web Page**, along with the denominators used in calculating percentages in the final column._

- [Census 2021 - Key Variables - PDF](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=824659)<br/>
  _The key census variables are described in full in this printable **PDF**, along with the denominators used in calculating percentages in the final column._

<!-- - [census2011.london.LA.xlsx](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2381595)<br/>
  _For reference, this Excel spreadsheet contains two worksheets with raw data (the original census counts) and percentages for the key census variables by borough. Denominators for percentages are listed in the variable names._ -->

These data from the 2021 Census have been inspired by data sets generated from the UK Census of 2011 by Profs. **Paul Longley** and **Alex Singleton**. I've transformed things a little to make them suitable for you through the software we are using. The full attribution for the original data source is at the bottom of the page.

Once you have downloaded the above, had a quick look at the data and feel you have a sense of what is recorded here, then it makes sense to begin to explore it through visualization _using the **Tableau** workbook_ ...

#### Tableau

<div class="imgBox" style="float:center; align:center">
<img width=600  src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.07.tableau.census2021.popDensity.png"/>
</div>

As you know, **Tableau** is great for producing graphics of our data sets and has the flexibility to produce a wide range of forms of visualization pretty quickly.
As **Tableau** develops it is also increasingly enabling us to perform many of the kinds of interactive operation that are important in data exploration:

> <code>select -> highlight -> group -> interrogate</code>

As we move through and between analytical tasks or foci ...

> <code>overview -> focus -> details -> record</code>

Using cycles and sequences of particular operations like ...

> <code>compare -> (re)encode -> compute -> (dis)aggregated</code>

So let's try visually exploring some of the data in **Tableau** in ways that were introduced in class.

Download the following packaged workbook and use the various views, dashboard feature and filter mechanism to explore the census geography of London.

- [Census 2021 Key Variables Data Set - Tableau Packaged Workbook](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=824660)

Remember to _look for_ and _record_ the kinds of output that were specified at the top of the document - these are :

- **differences** - between places, variables, etc;
- **interesting features** - that you see in the data ...
- **questions** or **hypotheses** ...

**REMEMBER** - as you are working you should jot down a few of the things you have noticed in your visual exploration of the data. It is important to **RECORD** your findings and progress.
You may want to do this in the **Tableau** workbook with features and capabilities like ...

- _Annotate_
- _Duplicate_
- _Dashboard_
- _Story_
- and _Save_

You may want to jot your ideas down elsewhere - you all have ways of taking notes.

You may want to save images with the <span class="menuText">Worksheet</span>, <span class="menuText">Export</span> feature.

You may want to save a worksheet by giving it a meaningful name and title, duplicating a copy. Remember to use <span class="menuText">File</span>, <span class="menuText">Save As...</span> to save a <code>TWBX</code> version of your _Tableau_ workbook before you move on.

Just be sure to record and capture interesting things!
