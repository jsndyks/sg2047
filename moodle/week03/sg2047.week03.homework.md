There are **TWO** tasks this week, and they are significant ones. But they are activities that you have already been asked to complete ðŸ‘‰

- **firstly** you need to work on the **Tableau - Getting Started** exercise and finish this off in your own time,
- **secondly** use the **DNA Tables - Examples & Explanations** document to consolidate the ideas about DNA tables and create / update your own

Sorry this page has come online a little late - _it's been a busy week!_<br/>
But the tasks are the same as those shown in the slides and flagged at the end of the lecture - so no surprises.<br/>
You need to complete them _before the Week 04 class_ please.

### HOMEWORK

_This week's homework should take you about **2 hours** to complete ..._

### 1. **Compete This Week's Practical Exercise**

###### TIME: approx. 2 hrs

It's absolutely essential that you spend time working through the _Tableau_ practical exercise introduced in class in _Week 03_.

[Practical Exercise : Tableau - Getting Started](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381620)<br/>- **work through the videos**, and use _Tableau_ to try out all of the features and possibilities.<br/><br/>**NOTE :** _Tableau_ did some strange things with the maps of the US when we tried it in class. Check this [Tableau Geography - Update](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2556774) for an explanation and solution.

2. [Tableau Getting Started Checklist](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2381621)<br/>- **complete the checklist**, ticking the concepts that you have covered and tried, and marking those that you found challenging or would like to discuss

3. [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=94494)<br/>- **use the forum** to discuss _Tableau_ concepts and experiences, and identify (and begin to resolve) any technical or conceptual challenges.

##### TASK 1 SUMMARY:

> _Complete the **Practical Exercise** and make sure that you can tick most of the items on the **Checklist**_

&nbsp;

### 2. **Check DNA Tables for some Example Data Graphics**

###### TIME: approx. 60 mins

I have produced a document that explains the _DNA Tables_ with examples from previous exercises.

1.  _**Check**_ through these [DNA Tables - Examples & Explanations](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2381619) and associated discussion and compare them with your efforts.

2.  _**Update**_ your DNA Tables as you learn.

    - _create tables for the graphics you see?_
    - _create tables for the graphics you make in Tableau?_

3.  _**Discuss**_ in our [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=2381582)

##### TASK 2:

> _Check, Update and Discuss your **DNA Tables** in light of these **Example Graphics and DNA Tables** and the associated discussion._

&nbsp;

### ?. **Complete Outstanding Homework!**

It's important that everybody has completed the tasks that have been set up until now.

Things will get much busier as term progresses and coursework is set, so please ensure that you are up to date with previous tasks, reading and homework.

These are important activities that are the foundation for the knowledge and skills that you will need to demonstrate in the assessed activities. So by doing them, you are effectively contributing to the coursework already. That's the way I design my courses, and they rely on you completing activities in good time.

##### EXTRA TASK SUMMARY ?:

> _Be sure to get up to date on the previous tasks!_ > _We will be building on these and moving at pace in the next few weeks!_
