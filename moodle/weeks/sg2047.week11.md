Our focus this week is on designing dashboards that make use of good practice in graphics to make sense of data through effective structured visual explanation.

We'll use examples and draw upon some suggested models for dashboard design and guidelines for good practice.

There will be some Tableau tips, so that we can all achieve some of this and use it in the coursework assignment ...
