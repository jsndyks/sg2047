We will be learning about _software_ through which we can visualize data, through a series of self-paced tutorials and exercises, in a hands on session using **Tableau**.

**PREPARATION**<br/>
Please make sure you have downloaded and installed [Tableau Desktop](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381590) onto your laptop or home computer before this week's class.<br/>
It is available for use in the computer laboratories in City, but you are entitled to a free copy as a student at City and can download and run this on your own machines too.

<!---
You also need to complete the [Week 02 - Homework](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381610) to consolidate last week's learning and prepare for _Making Data Graphics_!
