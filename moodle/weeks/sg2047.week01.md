We learn about the module, consider and discuss some examples of data visualization and then do some simple visualization by creating example graphics that represent numbers.

You'll begin looking at graphics, learning how to read them and thinking about the kinds of things they can tell you - facts, trends, relationships.
We will be thinking about why graphics are useful and how different graphics help you achieve different things.

**PREPARATION**<br/>
The most important thing is to show up on time, with plenty of energy and an enquiring mind, ready to learn!

If you can, I'd like you to check through the [Introduction](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45842#section-1) and [Communication]() sections here on the Homepage and familiarise yourself with the [Reading List](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2381588). If not, well, there's time to catch up!
