This week is reading week. Therefore the **live session will be a Q&A session** with no new material. You can ask questions, raise issues about and reflect upon the concepts introdued and used in the coursework. For example about the series of **Data Visualization Design Tests**, developed to act as visualization design heuristics (HeurVIStics)to help you design and evaluate data graphics.

We will not be talking about **specific** examples of efforts to complete the coursework, but we can talk about the concepts that you are working with in your coursework.\_

So, please **come to the online live-session with questions!**

<!---
**PREPARATION**<br/>

You should also watch the [Data Visualization Design Tests Video](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381645), that introduces these visualization heuristics or, er ..., **HeurVIStics** to make sure that you understand these concepts - **that are key to the coursework task**.
