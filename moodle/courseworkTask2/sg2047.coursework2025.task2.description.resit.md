#### The Task 

Your task is to demonstrate your knowledge of visualization (theory, practice, technology) and capabilities in visual exploration and design by creating a series of data graphics and a structured commentary on your work.<br/>
This individual piece of assessed coursework work will account for **70%** of your module mark.<br/>
It is described in detail in the [TASK 2 - DESIGN A DATA GRAPHIC - INSTRUCTIONS, RUBRIC &amp; SUBMISSION](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=824741).

**Instructions** are attached to this assignment area - have a look at the **PDF**.

Please submit all three items required, including ...

1. **PNG** - _a Single Static Image of a Dashboard created in Tableau._
This is the dashboard showing your Designs for Visualizing Society in London.
Make sure it is exactly the size and format requested in the instructions.<br/><br/>

2. **Online Text** - _Commentary : Description, Encodings, Decisions &amp; Reflection_
Your commentary - a 1,000 word script, to be consulted when viewing the Tableau dashboard.
The markers will read this as they view the dashboard.
The script must consist of _exactly_ **four sections**, each of no more than 250 words.
Add the script directly into the **online text** entry box ...<br/><br/>

3. **PDF** - _References_

Look for the rubric logo in the Submission Area to find the grading criteria.<br/>
You will find this when you click '**Add submission**' and should consult the criteria that are required for particular marks. Study these to inform and plan your approach.

Please note you **must** submit **all three items** through the submission area for Task 2 before the deadline.
Failure to submit any item will be recorded as non submission and therefore the work will not be graded.
