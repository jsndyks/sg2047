<!-- Each student has to focus on a different set of LSOAs in London. These are defined by a series of adjacent Boroughs.
In the following table you'll find the Boroughs that each of you should focus on - this is the region or 'Geographic Subset' you have been (randomly) allocated.

Please _only consider the LSOAs in the Boroughs you have been assigned in your coursework_ and use the **FILTER** mechanism in Tableau to remove the LSOAs from all other Boroughs in all of the graphics in your design.

Remember to focus on the variation _across_ and _within_ this area _at LSOA level_ – by designing effective graphics that show local detail and nuance rather than high level borough-based comparisons in your coursework. Once you have identified the area, and the LSOAs, you should not really need to mention the Boroughs themselves again - write about, talk about, show, annotate, focus attention on the nuanced patterns within London that are revealed through these high resolution multivariate data at LSOA level ... -->

Each student who is _Visualizing Society_ has to focus on a different area of London, a particular _geographic focus_.
These are defined by a series of adjacent LSOAs named **AREA-01** through to **AREA-16**.

In the following table you'll find the areas that each of you should focus on - this is the region or 'Geographic Subset' you have been (randomly) allocated.

Please _only consider the LSOAs in the AREA that you have been assigned in your coursework_ and use the **FILTER** mechanism in Tableau to remove all of the other LSOAs in London from all of the graphics in your design.

Remember to focus on the variation _across_ and _within_ this area _at LSOA level_ – by designing effective graphics that show local detail and nuance.
You will not be able to gain credit for the module if you focus on high level borough-based comparisons in your coursework.

Once you have identified the area, and the LSOAs, you should not really need to mention the Boroughs themselves again - write about, talk about, show, annotate, focus attention on the nuanced patterns within the region of London that you have been allocated that are revealed through these high resolution multivariate data at in the several hundred LSOAs that you are considering ...
