Some ideas about the key issues for the coursework.

The movie doesn't introduce anything new. It just clarifies where to find things and how to do things.

It is also a couple of years old, so there will be a few differences, particularly given that we are now dealing with 2021 data (rather than the 2011 Census)  - watch out for these!

If you have followed the materials, attended class, completed the exercises and read carefully then none of this should surprise you.

Sections are on :

1. The Data and LSOAs (where the data are)
2. Variable Names and Descriptions (what the data mean)
3. Explore / Record / Explain (process in Tableau)
4. Calculated Fields (how to calculate)
5. Criteria (standards and what will gain marks)
6. Word Counts (how to count and submit words)
