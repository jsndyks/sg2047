ONCE YOU HAVE UPLOADED THE FINAL VERSION OF YOUR WORK, YOU MUST ENSURE THAT YOU CLICK <code>SAVE CHANGES</code> then <code>SUBMIT ASSIGNMENT</code> OR YOUR WORK WILL NOT BE SUBMITTED FOR GRADING

If you have completed your assignment and are experiencing technical difficulties submitting it, then please attach your work to an email and send it to <code>ugsocandcrim@city.ac.uk</code> _before_ your deadline.

Please note that this may delay the marking process, so please only do this as a last resort. Note that technical issues are not usually considered valid reasons for late submission under the University's Extenuating Circumstances policy.
