<p>This is a <strong>voluntary</strong> submission intended to give you some individual feedback as you develop your coursework.</p>
<p>You can submit <strong>TWO</strong> items for feedback by an agreed deadline, to help you develop your submissions.  These are described below and must be in the formats specified. No other files or communication will be accepted for individual feedback - I want to give you all the same opportunities :</p>

<h6 class="mume-header" id="1-dashboard-a-single-static-image-of-a-dashboard-created-in-tableau-png">1. DASHBOARD – a Single Static Image of a Dashboard created in Tableau (PNG)</h4>

<p>This must contain your annotated graphics in a screen dump of a single Tableau dashboard – these are your <em>Designs</em> for <em>Visualizing Society in London</em>.<br/>
This series of annotated static graphics must present information established through your visual exploration in ways that show complexity with clarity.</p>
<p>The dashboard must be of <strong>landscape orientation</strong> at <strong>A3 size</strong> - <strong>1600*900</strong> pixels.</p>
<p>Create a PNG of your dashboard in Tableau with <code><em>Dashboard / Export Image ... / Portable Network Graphics (*.png)</em></code>. Remember that this is a <em>static</em> image – so it cannot rely upon any interaction or dynamic features such as tooltips, filtering, highlighting, etc. Imagine that you will be printing it out as a poster.</p>

<h6 class="mume-header" id="2-commentary-questions-encodings-decisions-questions-online-text">2. COMMENTARY &amp; QUESTIONS – Encodings, Decisions &amp; Questions (Online Text)</h4>

<p>A short script describing your work so far and identifying areas on which you would like feedback :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>your encodings</strong> – <strong>150 words</strong> ...<br/>
in which you describe <strong>SOME OF</strong> the encodings and explain how they are effective. You must explicitly select one of the graphics in your dashboard and draw on the guidance given by authors such as Roth (see the Variation test) and Munzner (remember her tables?) in your explanations. The graphic you select must be data dense and relational – showing information for all LSOAs and more than one variable while also representing more than one aspect of society. So – choose and design carefully!<br/>
<br></li>
<li><strong>your decisions</strong> – <strong>150 words</strong> ...<br/>
in which you identify <strong>TWO</strong> of the <em>Design Tests for Data Visualization</em> and explain whether they have been achieved in your graphics. You must explain <em>how</em> - if the tests are passed - and <em>why not</em> - if they are failed. Select <strong>ONE</strong> of your graphics as an example to show that the tests can be usefully passed to help visualize society, but also that there are circumstances when effective design involves failing them, for good reason. Your considered selections of the tests and the graphics will be key to doing well here. This is a great place to show your knowledge of the complexity of design and that you are aware of this and can still make informed design decisions.<br/>
<br></li>
<li><strong>your questions</strong> - <strong>100 words</strong> (max) ...<br/>
in which you ask me <strong>up to TWO</strong> specific questions that you would like feedback on.<br/>
I will try my best to give you help in answering them in my feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br/>
This is a voluntary assignment, that is <b>not</b> assessed.<br/>
It is used entirely as a means to give you feedback on your coursework as you make progress towards the submission date.<br/>
This is not an anonymous submission.<br/>
You will not be compromised in any way if you do not make a submission, or if you submit preliminary work.
Indeed, preliminary submissions are encouraged. Any submission made at this stage will not be considered when the final submissions are marked.</p>
<p><b>To reiterate, this activity is entirely independent of the final assessment and is not graded.
      It is intended to give you diagnostic information to help you develop good quality work for the final graded submission.</b></p>
