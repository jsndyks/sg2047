Your task is to demonstrate your knowledge of visualization (theory, practice, technology) and capabilities in visual exploration and design by creating a series of data graphics and a structured commentary on your work.<br/>
This individual piece of assessed coursework work will account for **70%** of your module mark.<br/>
It is described in detail in the [TASK 2 - DESIGN A DATA GRAPHIC - INSTRUCTIONS](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1202209/mod_assign/introattachment/0/sg2047.coursework202425.task2.v10.pdf)

2. **Online Text** - _Commentary : Description, Encodings, Decisions &amp; Reflection_
Your commentary - a 1,000 word script, to be consulted when viewing the Tableau dashboard.

Look for the rubric logo in the Submission Area to find the grading criteria.<br/>
You will find this when you click '**Add submission**' and should consult the criteria that are required for particular marks. Study these to inform and plan your approach.

Please note you **must** submit **all three items** through the submission area for Task 2 before the deadline.
Failure to submit any item will be recorded as non submission and therefore the work will not be graded.
