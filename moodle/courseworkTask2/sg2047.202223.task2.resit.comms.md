  <p style="color:#333">I will be able to provide <b>limited</b> support for you over the summer and this will be constrained to <b>one week</b> - from <b>Mon 24th July</b> -  <b>Fri 28th July</b>. You can contact me by e-mail or through Teams chat <b>during this week only</b> to ask questions about, seek clarification on, or discuss:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>feedback on your previous work</li>
    <li>the principles and literature that have been key to the module</li>
    <li>our expectations of you - but see the grading criteria / rubric first</li>
