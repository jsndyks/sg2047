If you are taking _Coursework Task 2_ this summer,
then head to the [Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=14949#) block on the Module homepage.
Download the original [Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic - INSTRUCTIONS](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1202209/mod_assign/introattachment/0/sg2047.coursework202425.task2.v10.pdf) and _read this document thoroughly_.

_This document describes what is required for your coursework assignment._

Check the in the _Grading Criteria_ in the _Rubric_ in [RESIT Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic - INSTRUCTIONS, RUBRIC & SUBMISSION](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=933382) to plan your work and ensure that you achieve the criteria required for a passing mark.

##### Re-Sit?

If you have completed the coursework before and already made a submission then have a look at this and the feedback that you were given in the original submission area - [Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic - INSTRUCTIONS & SUBMISSION](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=824741).
Use the feedback that we have provided to consider your work and identify ways in which the markers think it could be improved.

<div style="background-color:#ffff80; color:#b22; padding:8px; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; border:1px #e0e0e0 solid;" markdown=1>

You will need to re-do the coursework **using a new data set** as your focus **but with the same scenario** - so the same constraints and  requirements. You can change the variables and aspects of society that you focus on and the graphics, designs, encodings, and explanations that you use: this will be important as you visualize a particular part of London.

</div>

This is listed on the [Task 2 : Individual Focus - Geographic Subsets](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=898506) page.
You should apply the learning achieved through the feedback and your subsequent studies to the resit task.

You _must_, once again, _submit three files for a complete assignment_.

##### First Attempt?

Don't worry if this is your first go at the coursework, there are plenty of resources to help you. The key trick is to use them one at a time and work your way through to developing a good solution.

<!-- 
The best place to start may be the 25 min video that I produced following a feedback session on the task. This should really help frame the exercise for you: [Coursework Task 2 : Summary Feedback](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381695) video.
   -->

#### Data

You have an individual area in London on which to focus.<br/>
This is **new** for the resit coursework and different to any previous geographic subsets.<br/>
You select this from a common _Tableau_ as follows.<br/> 

1. Download the data from the 
[Task 2 : Data - Census 2021 Key Variables for London LSOAs - Tableau Workbook](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=824743&forceview=1) page;

<div style="background-color:#ffff80; color:#b22; padding:8px; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; border:1px #e0e0e0 solid;" markdown=1>
This is an updated workbook that contains the same 2021 Census data that we were using in the module and the Spring, but **different geographic regions** that you must use in your work over the Summer.<br/>
</div>

2. Identify the **AREA** that you have been allocated as your _geographic focus_ from the 
[Task 2 : Individual Focus - Geographic Subsets](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=898506) page;

3. Filter your worksheets so that you are only considering the LSOAs in the **AREA** that you have been allocated as your _geographic focus_.<br/> The short 
<a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=949889&forceview=1">Geographic Subset - How to Filter</a> video shows you how.

#### Tips for Everyone!

- Note that your work should make explicit reference to the **theory** and **principles** that we have discussed in the module, and you should engage with lecture materials and practical exercises to inform this work.

- Please use the _essential reading_ and other references that we have identified in the [SG2047: Visualising Society Module Reading List](https://rl.talis.com/3/city/lists/4D152441-27AB-C0A5-5DAD-E23F65978349.html) to inform this work. You will need to show that you can justify design decisions based upon this information.

- The [Design Tests for Data Visualization](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=824700) that we introduced in [Week 06](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=14949#section-10) should help you with your design decisions. Which tests does your graphic pass? And if it fails a test, why is this a reasonable decision? You need to show that you are aware of and able to use this kind of knowledge about design. The [Data Visualization Design Tests Video](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=890522) will help.

- Use the [Week 08 - Coursework - Task 2 Feed-forward](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824707) from the original task to inform your work.

<!-- 
- Try the [Coursework Task 2 : Summary Feedback](https://
moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381695) video that summarises some of the issues that cropped up when we had a feedback session on the task. **This may be a good place to start!**
 -->

 <!---
 * Check the [Task 2 : Coursework FAQ](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1611058) for answers to some commonly asked questions about the task and developing solutions to it.
 --->

- Be careful with word counts. Some applications, like _Microsoft Word_, count words differently to _Moodle_! Write your text in a Word processor, but check the word count in Moodle by making a preliminary submission well in advance of your final submission.

- Use _annotations_ on your dashboard to develop narrative. Tableau has great facilities for labelling and part of the task is for you to "_explain what you have discovered about society in London_". Effective labelling does this very nicely. See the _Annotation Test_ in the [Design Tests for Data Visualization](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=824700) for ideas and the examples in Part II of [The Big Book of Dashboards](https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/535E9DE8-194F-A3E2-7490-341696F2265B.html) to inspire your labeling.

- Use the [Tableau Training Videos](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824654) and other online resources to become proficient at using _Tableau_.

#### Returning to Campus

If you need to use facilities at the University to complete your work, including the library and Computer Labs, then please consult the important information that the University is providing on [Returning to Campus](https://libguides.city.ac.uk/returntocampus).
  --->

#### Important !

The work must be submitted to the [RESIT Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic - INSTRUCTIONS, RUBRIC & SUBMISSION](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=933382) submission area.

Work that is **not** submitted in this area before the deadline **will not be marked** and **a mark of 0** will be returned.
