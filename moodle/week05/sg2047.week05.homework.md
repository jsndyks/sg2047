There is plenty to do this week as you _prepare for_, and _begin working on_ [Coursework Task 1 : Assess a Data Graphic](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45842#section-17).

Let's discuss issues that arise, and any questions or ideas that you have on the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=2381582) forum.

Assuming you are up to date with previous tasks, videos, reading and other homework ...

### 1. **READ Coursework Task 1**

Read through [Task 1 Instructions](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3030283/mod_assign/introattachment/0/sg2047.coursework2023.task1.instructions.v10.230120.pdf?forcedownload=1) that were handed out in class and that are available in the [Coursework - Task 1: Assess a Data Graphic - INSTRUCTIONS, RUBRIC & SUBMISSION](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2541435) assignment area.

Make sure you understand what is being asked of you, what you submit and how to succeed.

<!---
Have a look at:

- [The Submission Area](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2381681) where you also find the [Coursework Instructions PDF](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/2663953/mod_assign/introattachment/0/sg2047.coursework2021.task1.instructions.v10.210212.pdf?forcedownload=1) - **Note:** the dates in the PDF are not correct. See the timetable at the beginning of the Section [Coursework Task 1 : Assess a Data Graphic](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45842#section-17)
--->

Check the [Coursework - Task 1 : Rubric](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2541436) to see the criteria and how to achieve marks.

Follow the link above or click <code>Add submission</code> and <code>View the Rubric used for marking</code> to see this.

<img height="40" width="280" style="padding-left:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/moodle.viewRubric.72.png"/><br/>

Please use the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=2381582) forum to ask questions and clarify any aspects of the task _at an early stage_ .

It is important that we are all clear about what is expected and that you engage with the task at an early stage.

### 2. **Watch the 3 summary videos**

**This is important!**
The videos help introduce key concepts to do with the coursework.

I have added them to the [SG2047 VisualizingSociety 2023](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2552891) video stream.

You need to watch these through _as soon as possible_:

- Levels of Measurement & Effective Encoding - **20 mins**
- Characteristics of Visual Variables - **15 mins**
- Selection / Association & Attention / Pre-Attention - **20 mins**

This will really support you in developing the _core knowledge_ that you need in the module.

### 3. **Check the Data Visualization Design Tests - HeurVIStics**

<div style="float:right">
<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/pics/week06.preparation.jpg" width=240px style="border:1px #bbb solid; margin:4px; padding:4px; margin-left:4em" />
</div>

**This is also very important**!<br/>
This task provides you with some _new information_ that you will need to use to complete the coursework.

You need to know the _Data Visualization Design Tests_ or _HeurVIStics_ to complete the _evaluation table_. We will chat about these in the Week 06 session, but you need to study them first.

Find out about them through these two explanations - a _PDF_ and a _video_ in the [Week 06](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45842#section-13) block, that describe the tests and should help you understand them.

- **PDF** - [Data Visualization Design Tests - HeurVIStics](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2381644)
- **VIDEO** - [Data Visualization Design Tests - HeurVIStics](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2381648) - **40 mins**

Please make a note of any tests that you would like to discuss and we can chat about them in the **week 06 Q&A session**.

Or, use the [The Moodle Discussion Forum](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=2381582) to discuss things before then.

### 4. **START Coursework Task 1**

Now you are set!

Have a look through some of the [Our World in Data](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2541437) page and start thinking about a graphic to select.

See the [Selected Data Graphics (Google Spread Sheet)](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2381685) - <b>find the row with your name and add the URL and the title of the selected graphic</b>. If you do this _by the end of week 05_, I will provide brief feedback on your choice in the Google Spread Sheet in the next few days.

Draft a _DNA Table_ or two, and think about making a selection.

And be sure to attend the Week 06 **Q&A**.

<!--
### 5. **Watch the Extra Extra Videos**

I also promised to add some discussion of the _Estimation Tasks_ that you took part in, and my take on the section of _The Big Book of Dashboards_ that you have read.

I have not produced these yet:

 * [Visual Variable Estimation Task - Analysis](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/a524aa8e-8495-466a-b80a-9de7e078bb59)
Here are the results of your estimation efforts - visually analyzed with effective encodings and accompanying DNA tables! Did you do as well (and badly) as I expected?
Find out on the [Module Video Stream](https://j.mp/sg2047stream21) - **20 mins**
 * [Selection / Association & Attention / Pre-Attention](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/bc374ce8-ca5d-409f-9014-78880f8816a8) and Visual Variables
 We look at some variations in visual characteristics and see whether we are able to select marks that have a particular variation with out fast pre-attentive visual processing.
 Does this scale - can we _ASSEMBLE_ patterns from multiple marks that we visually _SELECT_ as having similar variations in a visual variable, and so similar identities in our data set?
 Can we do so quickly, and when there are many marks on screen?
 Well, it depends on the visual variable and the degree to which variations differ. But use this video to understand _SELECTION_ and _ASSOCIATION_, and try the examples.
 Available on the [Module Video Stream](https://j.mp/sg2047stream21) - **20 mins**
 * **The Big Book of Dashboards**
 _Comments on Part I of TBBOD_ -- to come!

This is not as urgent as the other tasks that I am setting this week as they do not directly influence the coursework. But the videos will come before too long!
