Tableau Geography - Update

**Tableau** behaved strangely when we used it class to complete the _[Getting Started](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381620)_ exercise - plotting towns and cities from America in the UK!

Here's what to do to get those American places back over the Atlantic!

### Tableau Locations

_Tableau_ behaved strangely this week in ways that were not documented in any of their tutorials!

This happens from time to time as the software updates with regularity (good), but the tutorials sometimes take a while to catch up (not so good).

_Tableau_ seemed to try to locate American cities in the UK, and did a pretty bad job as a result!

A _full explanation_ follows, but if you want a quick fix, there is also a _short movie_ art the bottom of the page that shows you what to do.

These should help you deal with the _Tableau_ weirdness!

#### Full Explanation

I think we have a fix!

_Tableau_ decides where to put points on the map according to _Geographic Roles_. It tries to guess these, probably based upon where you are currently located. But if it gets this wrong, you can control them!

You can see the _Geographic Roles_ by clicking the menu items:

- <span class="menu">Map</span>, <span class="menu">Edit Locations</span>

Note that <code>Country/Region</code> is set to _United Kingdom_ and some of the _City_ names are matched with known places and locations in the UK.

But notice the ⚠️!

Click <span class="menu">Matching Location</span> and you'll see that many of the _City_ names in the data set are not well matched to places in the current _Country/Region_. So we need to change that!

So we need to change the _Country/Region_, _State/Province_ and _City_ to read data from columns in our dataset. Seems obvious!

Do this by clicking the _Country/Region_, _State/Province_ and _City_ drop-downs and choosing the correct **fields** in our data set.

This should fix things!

#### Short Movie

The whole process is captured in this short movie.

Just follow the steps!

#### DNA Epilogue

Of course this is a problem with Tableau's implementation of the encoding from :

| DATA CHANNEL | - DETAIL- | VISUAL VARIABLE |
| -----------: | :-------: | :-------------- |
|    Geography | - City -  | Location        |

<br/>
This row of a DNA table can be completed in all sorts of ways.
We don't specify the exact transformation in the DNA table - this is not captured.

But when can quickly see when the _Geography_ - _Location_ encoding has gone wrong and it makes it difficult for us to make sense of our data!

And _Tableau_ gives us various options as to how we actually execute or implement this encoding. The one that man of us got initially when we followed the tutorial in class was a bad one:

- _**Houston**? - we have a problem!_
