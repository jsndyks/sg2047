## Our World in Data (and Graphics)

I'd like you to spend time looking at some graphics or charts and selecting one that interests you.
I'd then like you to read the chart - let us know what it tells you.

We're going to focus on the amazing [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/#entries) project, which aims to use _research_, _data_ and _visualization_ of the data to address some of the World's most pressing problems. The reports produced since 2005 contain thousands of interesting charts - **graphics of data**.

This is a great source of interesting and informative efforts to visualize aspects of society across the planet so that we can compare places, identify trends and detect patterns and change.

I'd like you to look through the reports and find a chart, or data graphic, that interests you.

Here's what you need to do:

1. Check [Reports](https://ourworldindata.org/#entries) that seem interesting to look for candidate graphics.
   You'll find lots of themed reports that address important topics.
   And there are [thousands of data graphics](https://ourworldindata.org/charts)

2. Interact with the graphics - you can change the data that are shown and the way that they look in many cases.

3. Choose a graphic that tells you something you did not know.

4. When you have found a suitable graphic :

- record the **URL** of the graphic - the name of the Web page.<br/>
  In most cases you an click the <code>Share</code> icon under the graphic (_bottom right_) and then <code>Copy Link</code>

- record a **fact** that interests you and that you did not know until you had considered the graphic.<br/>It may be a surprising fact!

- find and record a **trend** or **relationship** that the graphic reveals or suggests<br/>Again, this may be surprising or interesting.

5.  Then record your findings through the [Find a Graphic - Reporting](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2381603) assignment

### Examples

Here are the kinds of things you might record - but _please don't use this particular example as there are plenty of other interesting charts to try_ and I'd like you to spend a little time looking through some of them.

#### A Chart

I might find this chart showing the [Share of population with drug use disorders, 2017](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-with-drug-use-disorders?time=2017) interesting. Have a look!

<!--- iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-with-drug-use-disorders?time=2017" style="width: 400px; border: 0px none;"></iframe--->

The URL is :

- <code>https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-with-drug-use-disorders?time=2017</code>

<img width="80%" style="padding-left:10%;padding-right:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/owid.share-with-drug-use-disorders.png" style="border:1px #bbb solid; margin:4px; padding:4px; margin-left:4em"/>

#### A Fact

The graphics are full of facts - things that you can determine directly from the graphic by reading it and/ or interacting with it. For example:

_The reported share of the population with drug use disorders ..._

- _... in the UK was 2.24% in 2017. (**absolute**)_
- _... is higher in the UK than elsewhere in Europe, but not as high as North America. (**relative**)_

#### A Trend or Relationship

If we look closely at a data graphic like this and have a think, and the graphic is reasonably well designed, then we should be able to see patterns and trends.
These are changes or differences that occur across time, space or category.
Here are a few examples of trends and relationships that we might report in this particular graphic:

_The reported share of the population with drug use disorders ..._

- _... has decreased over time in some countries:
  Puerto Rico, South Africa, Switzerland, Spain, Zambia, Zimbabwe. (**trend - temporal**)_

- _... is high in North America. (**trend - geographic / spatial**)_

- _... in Chile increases in line with that in Germany and France. (**relationship**)_

See what you can find!

### Reporting

Once you have done this, then please log your findings and (time permitting), I'll try to have a check through.

The [Find a Graphic - Reporting](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2381603) assignment is voluntary and not assessed.

It's intended to nudge you into finding and thinking about graphics and what they tell you, and to give me some feedback on how you are engaging and what you are thinking.
There is nothing to lose!

Good luck!
