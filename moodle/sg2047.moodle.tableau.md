We will be using **Tableau** throughout the module and for your coursework assignment. This page tells you how to access the software and install it for use on your own computer(s).

**Tableau** is commercial software for data visualization and visual analytics.
It has its roots in academia, with colleagues at Stanford University driving it forwards.
We will be using it in the lab at City throughout the module and you can install it on your own machines too.

We will point you to some introductions, tutorials and materials, but you will need to spend time getting good at using **Tableau** in your own time to do well on the module.

<div class="postIt" markdown=1>

I can't emphasise this enough - **please put time into learning Tableau early on in the module, and continue to do so throughout the term**.

My experience of teaching visualization using **Tableau** shows that it is an empowering tool that really helps students develop skills and make sense of data.<br/>But it also reveals a close correlation between:

- early use of **Tableau**, experimentation with it, and use of the online support materials, and
- **success in the module**.

So please use **Tableau** early on and use the support materials to get to know it.

### Computer Labs at City

**Tableau Desktop** is installed in the Windows PC labs at City, University of London.

It is called **Tableau 2021.N** on these machines and available through the alphabetically grouped application folders on the **Start menu**.<br/>(_N is a number that will be low at the start of the term, but may increase with software updates!_)

You can use Tableau on any of the machines in the computer labs, library or open access areas to undertake the work that you are required to do during this module.

### Your Own Computer(s)

As students at City, you can get a free license to install **Tableau** on your home computer for non-commercial use.
The license lasts for one year.

  <br/><a href="https://evision.city.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn">Create your own standard letters</a></li>
</ol>
  --->

1. Go to [https://www.tableau.com/academic/students](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students)
1. Click on <a class="tableau" href="https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop/download">GET TABLEAU FOR FREE</a>
1. Use "_City University London_" as your _School Name_.
   If "_City University London_" isn't listed, choose "_other_";</li>
1. Click the "_Verify using School Credentials_" button
1. Log in using your university username and password ('_credentials_')
1. Your license key and instructions for installing and using Tableau will appear in your City email inbox

You may need a _proof of status letter_. If so, you should be able to get one through[_evision_](https://evision.city.ac.uk). You can log on there and [create your own standard letters](https://evision.city.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn) should you need to.

If you need a _proof of status letter_ and are unable to acquire one, then contact your _Course Officer_.

You should get your _Tableau_ license straightaway, but if not, there's a 14-day free trial, so you can get started right away!

<!--- --- --->

### Tableau Public

There is also a free version of **Tableau** that only enables you to save and share data on _the cloud_ - **Tableau Public**.

This is **not** what you need for the module so **do not use Tableau Public** for your work on _SG2047 Visualizing Society_ .

You may need more functionality than it offers and since it makes all of your datasets available publicly this will not be not suitable for some the datasets we'll be using. I reiterate this is not suitable for your coursework.

So please avoid sharing the work that you undertake in _SG2047 Visualizing Society_ or posting it online.

One the module is over, feel free to use your Tableau and design skills to get involved in public data debate! But for now, use **Tableau Desktop**.

<!--- --- --->

### Training Videos

Tableau provide a whole host of [_Free Training Videos_](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381591).

Do use these excellent resources to learn **Tableau** and inform your work on the module.

You will find them extremely helpful as you master this important software for exploring and explaining structure in data as you visualize society.
