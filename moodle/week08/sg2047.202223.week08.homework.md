There's plenty to do this week as begin working on [Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45842#section-21).

Be sure to raise questions and engage in discussion in the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=94494) forum.

### 0. **Catch Up!**

My guess is that some of you are a little behind with some of the weekly activities.

Now is the time to catch up!

#### Visual Variable Estimation Task

I am concerned that so few of you have completed the [Visual Variable Estimation Task](https://cityunilondon.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6rodpArp96UmlZb) that was part of the [Week 04 - Homework](0https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381631).

Here is a reminder of the Estimation Task ðŸ‘‡ from Week 04.<br/>**Please complete it this week**.

<div style="font-size:80%; background-color:#fbfff4;padding:1px; padding-left:2em; padding-right:2em;" markdown=1>

#### **Estimation Task**

We will be thinking about the use of _Visual Variables_ for key visualization tasks next week.
One of these will be the estimation of **quantities** from visual different variables.

To get the hang of this, I would like you to have a go in advance.

Please spend _10 minutes_ or so completing the _short estimation task_ exercise:

- [Visual Variable Estimation Task](https://cityunilondon.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6rodpArp96UmlZb)

You do not have a **Prolific ID**, so when this is mentioned, just leave it blank and continue.

Have a think about what this experience might have taught you!

##### TASK 3 SUMMARY:

> _Please complete the [Visual Variable Estimation Task](https://cityunilondon.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6rodpArp96UmlZb) before next week's session and have a think about how things went!_ <br/> _Did you learn anything?_

</div>

#### Getting Started with Tableau

I was also a little concerned at some of the questions I was getting about using _Tableau_ in class yesterday. You need to complete your checklist and make sure that you have dona all of the learning associated with the [Practical Exercise : Tableau - Getting Started](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381620) exercise from [Week 03](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45842#section-9).

You were asked to spend _about an hour_ studying the videos and trying the functionality in _Tableau_ :

- [Tableau Training Videos](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381591)

**You need to do this!**

&nbsp;

### 1. **Coursework Task 1 - Feedback**

Be sure to check your marks in the [Grader Report](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/grade/report/grader/index.php?id=45842) and check your submission in the [Coursework - Task 1: Assess a Data Graphic - INSTRUCTIONS, RUBRIC & SUBMISSION](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2541435) assignment area.

There should be an _audio file_ giving you some _feedback_ and there may be annotations added to the submission. So please open the submission and check for these.

The read through the [Week 08 - Coursework - Task 1 Feedback](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381653), which includes some examples and discussion that may be helpful in light of the submissions that I marked.

### 2. **Coursework Task 2 - FeedForward / Getting Started**

Once you are up to date with previous tasks, videos, reading and other homework (do check the tasks in the sections above ðŸ‘†), then it's time to start the second assignment ...

I have added some guidance on _Coursework Task 2_ - please read through the [Week 08 - Coursework - Task 2 - Feed Forward (Getting Started)](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381654), which should help you get going on the task.

#### **UNDERSTAND Coursework Task 2**

Read through the documents in the [Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic - INSTRUCTIONS & SUBMISSION](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2381689) and make sure you understand what you need to do, how you will submit and how you will be assessed. This is vital in helping you to succeed.

Check the arrangements for :

- Clarifying the Coursework Instructions
- [Formative Feedback](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2381694) on your work as it develops

Make a note of the deadline(s) in your diary and set your own deadlines for reading through the coursework instructions, initial submission, and final submission.
Your personal deadline for _final submission_ should be well before the Moodle assignment facility closes.

Please use [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=94494) forum to ask questions and clarify any aspects of the task.

It is important that we are all clear about what is expected and that you engage with the task at an early stage.

The [Coursework Instructions (PDF)](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3030288/mod_assign/introattachment/0/sg2047.coursework2023.task2.v1.pdf) are attached to the submission area on Moodle.

<!-- **IMPORTANT** : I will answer questions _about the instructions and their interpretation_ for one week following the release of the coursework and then issue revised instructions if anything needs further clarification. So _please engage at this stage_ to make sure that we all understand what you have to do. -->

<!---
This is now inm FeedFORWARD

> **IMPORTANT REMINDER**: I will discuss the coursework instructions and answer questions about their interpretation for _ONE WEEK_ following the release of the coursework. If you have questions or require clarifications then please let me know and I will do my best to address these.
> _If necessary_, I will produce an updated version of the coursework instructions after this period, with edits highlighted and inform you that an update has been made.
> After this period I am of course happy to discuss your progress on the coursework and to help you explore, design and problem solve, but I will not be commenting _on the Coursework Instructions_ or _their interpretation_.

#### **START Coursework Task 2**

Use the methods we learned about for [Data Exploration](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45842#section-14) to iteratively explore the census and find out more about the [Individual Focus or Geographic Subset](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381690) of London that you have been allocated.

If you have not completed the [Practical Exercise - Exploring the Census with Tableau](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381652), then try this out and post some ideas about your area of London:

- differences;
- interesting features;
- questions or hypotheses;

The **Exploration Process** diagram in the [Practical Exercise - Exploring the Census with Tableau](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381652) is intended to give you some ideas.

<div style="padding-left:10%; padding-right:10%">
<img src="http://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/sg2047.201920.week07.slides.explore.v1.png" width="80%"/>
</div>

Make sure that you can achieve the objectives listed at the top of the document:

> Make sure you can do these things - you should practice them, try things out, experiment.

Go for it - load the data into _Tableau Desktop_ and _explore London_ from the safety of your own home!

Let others know what you find.
