There's plenty to do this week as begin working on [Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=37070#section-17).

Be sure to raise questions and engage in discussion on [The Module Teams Channel](https://j.mp/sg2047team21).

Assuming you are up to date with previous tasks, videos, reading and other homework ...

### 1. **Coursework Task 1 - Feedback**

Be sure to check your marks in the [Grader Report](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/grade/report/grader/index.php?id=37070) and check your submission in the [Coursework - Task 1: Assess a Data Graphic - INSTRUCTIONS, RUBRIC & SUBMISSION](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=1831818) assignment area.

There should be an _audio file_ giving you some _feedback_ and there may be annotations added to the submission.

The read through the [Week 08 - Coursework - Task 1 Feedback](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1611029), which includes some examples and discussion that may be helpful in light of the submissions that I marked.

### 2. **Coursework Task 2 - Feed-Forward**

I have added some guidance on _Coursework Task 2_  - please read through the [Week 08 - Coursework - Task 2 Feed-forward](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1611030), which should help you get started.

### 3. **READ Coursework Task 2**

Read through the documents in the [Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic - INSTRUCTIONS & SUBMISSION](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=1831819) and make sure you understand what you need to do, how you will submit and how you will be assessed. This is vital in helping you to succeed.

Please use [The Module Teams Channel - COURSEWORK TASK 2](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a2c2d32a52ffb4d61a45e4d2bb3a2fd44%40thread.tacv2/COURSEWORK%2520TASK%25202?groupId=649c1a9d-adeb-4c7c-bbed-83f8c9ef88a3&tenantId=dd615949-5bd0-4da0-ac52-28ef8d336373) to ask questions and clarify any aspects of the task.

It is important that we are all clear about what is expected and that you engage with the task at an early stage.

The [Coursework Instructions](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/2244425/mod_assign/introattachment/0/sg2047.coursework2021.task2.v1.210307.pdf?forcedownload=1) are attached to the submission area on Moodle.

<!-- **IMPORTANT** : I will answer questions _about the instructions and their interpretation_ for one week following the release of the coursework and then issue revised instructions if anything needs further clarification. So _please engage at this stage_ to make sure that we all understand what you have to do. -->

> **IMPORTANT**: I will discuss the coursework instructions and answer questions about their interpretation for *ONE WEEK* following the release of the coursework. If you have questions or require clarifications then please let me know and I will do my best to address these.
_If necessary_, I will produce an updated version of the coursework instructions after this period, with edits highlighted and inform you that an update has been made.
After this period I am of course happy to discuss your progress on the coursework and to help you explore, design and problem solve, but I will not be commenting _on the Coursework Instructions_ or _their interpretation_.

### 4. **START Coursework Task 2**

Use the methods we learned about for [Data Exploration](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=37070#section-11) to iteratively explore the census and find out more about the [Individual Focus or Geographic Subset](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1611056) of London that you have been allocated.

If you have not completed the [Practical Exercise - Exploring the Census with Tableau](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1846183), then try this out and post some ideas about your area of London:

 * differences;
 * interesting features;
 * questions or hypotheses;

The **Exploration Process** diagram in the [Practical Exercise - Exploring the Census with Tableau](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1846183) is intended to give you some ideas.

</div>

Go for it - grab Tableau and _explore London_ from the safety of your own home!

Let others know what you find.
