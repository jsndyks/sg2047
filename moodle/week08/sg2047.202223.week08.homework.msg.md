Hello Folks.

I have added a HOMEWORK page for Week 08 that lists 3 important activities, as discussed in class yesterday.

- https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381655

Please complete these in good time to catch up (if you need to), check on progress, and get going with **Coursework Task 2**

- **Catch Up** - make sure you are up to date with learning activities
- **FeedBACK** - check through my thoughts on Coursework Task 1
- **FeedFORWARD** - some ideas to get you started on Coursework Task 2

You will also find details of the voluntary FEEDBACK submission, through which you can get some guidance on your progress as you develop your coursework solutions.

Check the Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic block on Moodle:

Enjoy the blossom.
