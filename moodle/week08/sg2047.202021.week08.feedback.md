### Week 08 : Coursework - Task 1 - FeedBACK

The provisional marks for Task 1 are released on Moodle. All work was marked anonymously against the published criteria.
See the [GradeBook](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/grade/report/grader/index.php?id=14949) for marks and your original submission for feedback.

Check the submission itself for any _notes_ or _annotations_ - I added these in most cases - I think you have to click a blue icon, maybe a pencil, to see my comments.
Please also check the criteria - the _rubric_ - as you have been awarded marks against each criterion. It is important that you check the level that you have achieved and read the comments that relate to that level.

Note that the marks are provisional and subject to change following :

- **moderation** - a check on the integrity and consistency of the marks;
- the **Board of Assessment** - external and internal examiners will review the marks in June to consider any accepted extenuating circumstances and to check that quality processes are in order and that standards are consistent with other courses and modules;

So - **Nobody has passed or failed anything at all, yet**.<br/> These are indicative, rather than final module, marks.
They are initial marks that give you a sense of how I think you are doing.
They may change as part of our quality control processes.

There is no opportunity or indeed need to resit or resubmit anything as yet.
Please carry on learning on the module and use this _feedback_ to inform your approach.

There will be no discussion of individual marks before the Board of Assessment, but I can discuss performance in general terms and of course, enjoy chatting about visualization, design, Tableau ...!

### General issues ...

<!---img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/sg2047.202021.feedback.task1.png" width=400--->

On the whole - the standard of the work submitted was very good.

- detailed
- informed
- pleasing!

Summary stats follow ...

<div class="mdTable" markdown=1>

|        Summary Stats | &nbsp; |
| -------------------: | -----: |
|        _Submissions_ | **40** |
|      _Passing Marks_ | **40** |
|    _Non-Submissions_ |  **6** |
|               _Mean_ | **63** |
|             _Median_ | **63** |
|    _75th Percentile_ | **71** |
|    _25th Percentile_ | **55** |

</div>

Or, in the expressive and rich language of graphics ...

<div class='imgBox' style='float:center; align:center'>
<img width=600  src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/sg2047.task1.MarksDistribution.png"/>
</div>

From what I have seen so far ... you have learned plenty!

The module mark is weighted average for Task 1 and Task 2:

> **Module Total = (Task1Mark x 0.3) + (Task2Mark x 0.7)**

Overall pass mark for the module is **40%**

### Errors

A few things went wrong for a few of you ...

##### Submission Length

I asked for two pages - some of you gave me three. I only looked at the first two pages in these cases.

It is very important that you submit assignments that comply with the instructions because these constraints are what enable us to make fair comparisons, and get our marking done on time!

Imagine if I said “_submit as many pages as you like_”.

How would you make fair comparisons between students if they all sent you completely different things?

Imagine if some of you worked hard thinking, spending time, being succinct, rephrasing, cutting information, selecting what to say and what to omit, to come up with a submission that fitted on to two pages - and then I let others submit an extra paragraph, or half a page, or an extra page even. That's not fair.

I will do everything that I can to treat everybody in the same way and to be as clear as possible about what this is. If you have questions - ask! 

##### HeurVIStics Selected

Some of you included HeurVIStics that were not on the list of 12 that I wanted you to select from. I didn’t consider these. 

##### Data Graphics Selected

Some of you did not select graphics with “_many_” data items that were “_relational_” - encouraging comparison between variables and characteristics.

##### Roth's Guidance

Many of you suggested that _SIZE_ was a **P** (poor) or **M** (marginal) encoding for numeric (quantitative) data.

Roth considers it to be **G** (good) and this is what I was looking for really - but I guess that you were thinking about Munzner's table (where _SIZE)_ is ranked below the positional visual variables and the issues to do with size underestimation (for smaller marks) and the challenges associated with _SIZE_ estimation as shape varies.

I was not too hard on you here, particularly if the issue was discussed in light of the _Data Vis Design Tests_ selected in the _Evaluation_ section.

### Issues for Discussion

Some examples of issues that I noticed when the marking that seem to be worthy of further consideration and discussion ...

#### An Additional Encoding? (_of an unencoded data channel_)

There seems to be a data channel that is not encoded in some of the graphics, where not all marks are of entities of the same scale.

For example, marks in some of the _scatter-plots_ that you selected related to counties on the whole, but in some cases they represent _continents_ and even _the World_.

For example ...

- [Fertility rate versus female labor force participation, 2010](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fertility-and-female-labor-force-participation?time=2010&country=High-income+countries~Lower-middle-income+countries~Upper-middle-income+countries~OWID_WRL)

<div style="float:right">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/ourWorldInData.STRUCTURE.world.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>


Can we also communicate this by adding an encoding for _Scale of Geographic Entity_?
We might consider this to be **nominal**, and _SHAPE_ would work well here according to the guidance.

<div class="mdTable" markdown=1>

| Data                       | Detail    | LoM     | VV    | Guidance |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------- | ----- | -------- |
| Scale of Geographic Entity | 3 classes | Nominal | Shape | **G**    |

</div>

But, if you think about it, there is an **order** to scale, and Roth's guidance suggests that _SHAPE_ doesn't work well for order.

<div class="mdTable" markdown=1>

| Data                       | Detail    | LoM     | VV    | Guidance |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------- | ----- | -------- |
| Scale of Geographic Entity | 3 classes | Ordinal | Shape | **P**    |

</div>

<!---img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/week08.dnaTable.feedback.png" width=600/--->

But, maybe we use _SHAPE_ for _Scale of Geographic Entity_?
Perhaps a series of variations of _SHAPE_ that vary sequentially, systematically, can help here? 

Is this an _ordinal_ shape encoding that is likely to work?<br/>From more to less open (or less to more filled)?

 <img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/continentShape.png" width=200/>

The extent to which a shape is _open_ or _filled_ may enable us to interpret **order**. The marks that vary in *_SHAPE_ can still carry _HUE_, and so we can relate them to continents. And as continents and _World_ are bigger than countries the larger open shapes may help us with the occlusion / **DETECTION** problem that tends to occur in scatter plots.

It's a plausible design idea!
_What do you think?_

Try the [Data Visualization Design Tests](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=824700) (_the HeurVIStics_) :

 * **DETECTION**?
 * **ASSEMBLY**?
 * **PROPORTION**?

#### Resolution Inconsistency? (_where do the data come from_)

In some cases, the data values that showed up in the _ToolTip_ and indeed in the associated _Data Table_ didn't seem to relate to the positions of the marks in the graph.

For example ...

- [Quality vs. quantity of schooling, 2020](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/quality-vs-quantity-of-schooling?time=2020)

<div style="float:right">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/ourWorldInData.RESOLUTION.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

Here, the _Expected years of schooling_ on the x-axis are all round numbers, full years, but the positions are at much higher resolution.

See _Eswatini_, which has a value of **6**, but a position on the x-axis that suggests a value of around **6.5**. That's a discrepancy of 6 months schooling, or 8% of an education!

Where do these data some from?<br/>Is this a random _jittering_ that compromises the **PROPORTION** test?<br/>Or are these real data that are not shown in the _Data Table_ or _ToolTip_? 

#### More Comparison? (_add a data channel for a more somparative graphic_)

Many of the scatter plots used a *SIZE* encoding ... but not all of them.

For example ...

- [Deaths rates from disasters vs. GDP per capita, 2023](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-disaster-gdp)

<div style="float:right">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/ourWorldInData.COMPARISON.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

*SIZE* would have been a useful encoding here as the impact of any disaster is a function of _Death Rate_ (Deaths per 100,000) and _numbers of people_ (Population).

But other encodings might have been helpful
  - *SHAPE* to show trend - whether rates have gone up or down recently (▲▼)
  - *SIZE* to show expenditure (per capita) on disaster prevention or relief

Any of these additional encodings would have provided a more relational graphic and a more convincing 'YES' to the question - _has the **COMPARISON** test been passed here_?

#### Inconsistent Colour Encoding?

In some of the graphics, _grey_ (a colour with zero _SATURATION_) is used to encode two different qualities:
  - aggregations of countries into _continents_ or _World_, and
  - _NoData_

<!--
See here for example ...

- [Children per woman vs population growth, 2020](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-vs-population-growth?tab=chart&country=&region=World)
 -->

Such cases fail the **CONSISTENCY** test.

#### Structure in Categories is Not Encoded

Some more issues with colour ...
in many graphics  _SouthAmerica_ and _Africa_ are encoded with very similar colours, which makes them hard to **DISCRIMINATE**.
It is particularly difficult to **DISCRIMINATE** colours where sizes of marks that carry the colour are small.

<p style="padding-left:4em"><img width=100 height=120  src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/ourWorldInData.key.continents.png"/></p>

We would be able to **ASSOCIATE**, **SELECT** and **DISSOCIATE** more easily if the colours were more distinguishable - either with more different _HUE_ or greater variations in _LIGHTNESS_ - using, for example, a [ColorBrewer Qualitative 7-Class Scheme](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Dark2&n=7)

And yet there is **STRUCTURE** in the nominal data. _South America_ and _North America_ share a continent, or a 'mega-continent' (America). As _HUE_ is _associative_ we may want to give these two **nominal** categories a similar _HUE_ so that we can identify this relationship when we are trying to **ASSEMBLE** patterns in the data?

We might additionally vary _LIGHTNESS_ to differentiate between the _North_ (darker) and _South_ (lighter) hemispheres?

<div class="mdTable" markdown=1>

| Data      | Detail                         | LoM     | VV        | Guidance |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------- | --------- | -------- |
| Geography | Hemisphere<br/>(north / south) | Nominal | Lightness | P        |
| Geography | 5 Mega-Continents              | Nominal | Hue       | G        |

</div>

It's a plausible design idea!
It enables us to encode spatial relationships between _The Americas_ and the _Northern_ and _Southern_ hemispheres - two additional geographic data channels.<br/>
_What do you think?_<br/>
_Can we justify that **P** (poor) for **Guidance** (according to Roth) as there are only two categories in our *LIGHTNESS* geography encoding?_

Effectively we are employing a [ColorBrewer Paired Scheme](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Paired&n=8)

<div class="mdTable" markdown=1>

</div>

The right hand column above reduces _SATURATION_ to 0%, and so we can see how _LIGHTNESS_ varies within the proposed structured colour scheme - to show North/South hemispheres.

I would also probably deploy an additional visual variable (not colour) to show 'No Data' - maybe a variation in _TEXTURE_, for example.

#### Detection Strategies

<!-- Look for omissions:
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/depression-by-level-of-education-employment?time=earliest..latest&country=~GBR%20 -->

There is a _trade-off_ between **ESTIMATION** and **DETECTION** and **ASSEMBLY** and **PROPORTION** in use of _Logarithmic_ (log) scales!

- [Share of one-person households vs. GDP per capita, 2016](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/one-person-households-vs-gdp-per-capita)
- [Expected years of schooling vs. share in extreme poverty, 2023](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/expected-years-of-schooling-vs-share-in-extreme-poverty?time=2023)

<div style="clear:both"/>
<div style="float:right">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/ourWorldInData.PROPORTION.log.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

Here [_Share of population in poverty_](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/expected-years-of-schooling-vs-share-in-extreme-poverty?time=2023) is plotted on a logarithmic scale meaning that the **PROPORTION** and **PROXIMITY** tests are compromised so that **DETECTION** and **ASSEMBLY** can be performed.

<div style="clear:both"/>
<div style="float:right">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/ourWorldInData.PROPORTION.lin.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

The effects can be seen, and the alternative assessed, by varying the _Settings_ of the interactive graphic. Here [_Share  of population in poverty](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/expected-years-of-schooling-vs-share-in-extreme-poverty?xScale=linear&time=2023) is plotted on a linear axis meaning that the **PROPORTION** and **PROXIMITY** tests are passed.

We can scale quantities if we have a skewed distribution and want to :

- spread similar values out so that we can **DETECT** them;
- see relationships that are not linear through graphical **ASSEMBLY**

Various strategies exist in these graphics for for **DETECTION** and **ASSEMBLY** :

- _layering_ - plotting the smaller marks on top of the larger ones allows us to see the smaller marks but perhaps reduces apparent size of larger symbols - **PROPORTION** compromise
- _opacity_ - making the marks semi-opaque allows us to see overlaps but reduces resolution of colour encoding - **DISCRIMINATION** compromise
- _openness_ - open shapes allow us to see overlaps but reduce our ability to apply and detect colour encoding - **DETECTION** compromise
- _log scale_ - moves clustered marks apart but makes it hard to estimate quantities - **PROPORTION** compromise

Heh heh!<br/>

### HeurVIStics!

Some clarifications regarding a few of the _Data Visualization Design Tests_ ...

#### The VARIATION Test

This test is about the _level of measurement_ in the data and the encoding applied.
Use the guidance from Roth, Munzner and [Brewer](http://colorbrewer.org) to make judgments about whether the encodings are appropriate.

<!---
I saw very little on [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/), which is an excellent and informative resource. Do have a play - check the [Lecture Links]() from
--->
<!---
Please have a look and check the [Module Video Stream](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2552891) for an introduction to **ColorBrewer** - try [SG2047 - Week 05 - Effective Data Graphics](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/860dc5cf-a87b-4f1a-8dba-a9738c1c7900)from about <code>1:25:30</code>
--->

Level of measurement by _Munzner_ ...

- Identity - Nominal
- Magnitude - Ordinal, Interval, Ratio

Some of you considered **numeric data**, data with **magnitudes**, to be nominal.
Nominal means **named** - named only, with no order or quantity.

See the [Guidance Documents](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2381642) from the _Effective Data Graphics_ class.

<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/sg2047.guidance.LoM.png" width=600/>

And then we are interested in whether or not _effective_ visual channels are employed.

Again, the [Guidance Documents](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=824697) from the _Effective Data Graphics_ class helps here.

The slides from that session - including Robert Roth's table - let you make and justify judgments about the encoding.

They explain the qualities of the visual variables, and how well they work - _SYNTACTICS_.

<!--img src="http://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/roth.2015.Fig2.png" width=600/-->

Which visual variables have which characteristics?<br/>
Which work best for which qualities, Levels of Measurement?

##### Roth's Guidance

<img width=400 src ="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/sg2047.guidance.Roth.Fig1.png"/>

#### The ESTIMATION Test

- _can you **ESTIMATE** quantities from items? quickly, consistently and accurately_

Tamara Munzner's _Ordered Magnitude Channels_ rank visual variables in terms of their effectiveness for estimation tasks.

##### Munzner's Rankings

<img width=600 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/sg2047.guidance.munzner.mag.png" />

Munzner also has rankings for _identity_.<br/>
How well do the visual variables that have _associative_ properties work for establishing and differentiating between the identities that occur in _nominal_ data? (_Categorical ata with no order_)

#### The PROPORTION Test

Sometimes you need to get out a ruler to check this through.

If you look closely at **Our World in Data** some examples do not encode population via size in ways that pass the **PROPORTION** test:

- [Children per woman vs population growth, 2020](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-vs-population-growth?tab=chart&country=&region=World)

<div style="float:right">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/ourWorldInData.PROPORTION.both.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

Here many countries,including _Guatemala_ and _Faroe Islands_, have circles that are identical size despite populations that are very different.

In the case of _Guatemala_ and _Faroe Islands_ the difference is huge: _3 orders of magnitude_. That's right, there are 53,000 in the _Faroe Islands_ and more than 17,000,000 people in _Guatemala_ - a ratio of 333:1.

<div style="clear:both"/>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/ourWorldInData.compare.FARGUA.png" width=192 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

Presumably there is a minimum size for each dot, and presumably this is so that the graphic passes the **DETECTION** test. One test is compromised to achieve another.

We can see this even more clearly if we break the **PROXIMITY** test and move the marks closer together.

<div style="float:right">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/ourWorldInData.compare.FAR.legend.png" width=100 style='padding-left:2em'/><br/>
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img/ourWorldInData.compare.GUA.legend.png" width=100 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

Interestingly (and pretty effectively in my view) the failure of the **PROPORTION** test is addressed by the interactive legend - look to the right when you mouse over a mark in the interactive scatter plot.

And look to the right here to see the _Faroe Islands_ mark at its **PROPORTIONAL** size (left, blue) in comparison to _Guatemala_ (right, reddish)- it's tiny!

As you mouse-over the inaccurately **PROPORTION**ed, but thankfully **DETECT**able marks, their **PROPORTION**al *SIZE*s are shown in the legend.

</div>

Let's look at some examples from beyond **Our World in Data**.

Consider the lengths of the bars about social media on the right.
Is the bar for _Watching Videos_ (54%) more than three times the length of the bar for _Tweeting_ (15%)?

Look at the x-axis in the [Now Wash You Hands](https://visual.ly/community/Infographics/health/now-wash-your-hands) graphic on the right - produced before anybody had heard of _COVID-19_!

Consider the positions and values of the first four circles on the x-axis ..? Particularly _MRSA_ and _HIV_.
Consider the variation in the Y axis.
Why do we have labels for X-axis values (that are easy to estimate on a linear scale) rather than on the Y-axis (which uses a much more cognitivelsy demanding log scale)?

The proportion test applies to components of colour as well as position, length, size, angle ...

Now wash your hands!

#### The POSITION Test

<div style="float:right">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img//planets-to-scale.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em'/>
</div>

Don't forget **LOCATION** or **POSITION** - a few of you did!

Really think hard about how your graphic is using **LOCATION** / **POSITION**?
This defines the kind of chart you produce and the kinds of relationships that your graphic will enable you to detect.

How is **LOCATION** or **POSITION** being used in this graphic of [The Planets to Scale](https://space-facts.com/the-planets-to-scale/)?

> **BUT**: Can you think of another TEST that it passes?

In _maps_ the position of items on the ground is encoded through their *LOCATION* or *POSITION* in the graphic.
And this really limits our ability to use *LOCATION* or *POSITION* to :

- line things up (**ALIGNMENT**)
- encode magnitudes (**ESTIMATION**, **PROPORTION**)
- etc.

So we are always having to use less expressive and effective encodings for the qualities and quantities that we want to put encode in the map, such as :

- colour (_VALUE_, _HUE_, _SATURATION_)
- _SIZE_

We have to move down Munzner's chart (see above) some way when we are producing maps that use _position_ to encode geography.

In other graphics, work out what coordinate system is being used ...

- Cartesian? (such as a map or a scatter plot)
- radial? (like a pie chart)
- ranking (ordered)
- ... or what!

If one aspect or dimension (for example - the Y axis) of *LOCATION* or *POSITION* is not being used -- then there is room for a more relational, comparative, data dense graphic by using it to encoding a data channel.

<div style="float:right">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img//informationIsBeautiful.whenSeaLevelsAttack.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em' />
</div>

And just because a graphic is about _places_, does not mean that the _geographic relationships_ between these places, their positions on the ground, or the _geography_, need to be encoded.

<div style="float:right">
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week08/img//visually.someCountriesRequireVacation.png" width=400 style='padding-left:2em' />
</div>

- [Did You Know Some Countries Require Vacation?](https://visual.ly/community/Infographics/business/did-you-know-some-countries-require-you-take-vacation)

There is nothing in either of these two graphics that enables us to estimate, interpret or use the positions of these cities and countries in our analysis of the data.

Could we add a geographic encoding in these data graphics to help us see how things vary spatially?

So **geography** is not encoded in the first graphic (other than in the mini maps).
And **geography** is only encoded in the second graphic with _HUE_ (other than the weird map label), which does not enable us to see spatial variation very well as it has no order and so is a **P**oor visual variable for encoding ordinal and numeric data channels).

### Specific Examples

Some examples to consider, deconstruct and discuss ...

#### USA Map

http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/common-standards-and-assessment-consortia-membership_5065beff5a835.jpg[Assessment Consortia Membership]

Let's deconstruct :

* data channels
* visual channels

Let's think about the _Data Visualization Design Tests_ :

 * *The PROXIMITY Test*

 ** _Are things that have similar characteristics close together?_

 * *The POSITION Test*

 ** _Is *POSITION* used to show the most important relationships between information?_

 * *The CONSISTENCY Test*

 ** _Is *HUE* used consistently across the graphic to show relationships between items?_
 ** _Use encodings *CONSISTENTLY* across a composite graphic_

In Breaking Bad, http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/breaking-bad-how-much-money-does-walt-have-left_50291aa3d0990.jpg[What Does Walt Have Left to Build an Empire?]

Let's deconstruct :

* data channels?
* size of data matrix
* visual channels
  - *position*?
  - *colour* - check http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=9[ColorBrewer]

How about the _Data Visualization Design Tests_ :

 * The *EFFICIENCY* Test

 ** _Is any *DOUBLE ENCODING* necessary and justified when used for emphasis?_

#### Chinese City Size

image::http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/the-chinese-population_50290a6cd2104.gif[200,200,float="right"]

http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/the-chinese-population_50290a6cd2104.gif[The Long Tail]

Let's deconstruct :

* data channels
* visual channels
* level of measurement

Let's consider the **DNA** of the graphic ...

====
* _URBAN AREA POPULATION_ - RATIO - SIZE
* _URBAN AREA POPULATION_ - ORDINAL - SATURATION
* _URBAN AREA POPULATION_ - BINARY (whether <2 million) - HUE
* _URBAN AREA POPULATION_ - ORDINAL - LOCATION (y)
====

 * The *EFFICIENCY* Test

 ** _Is any *DOUBLE ENCODING* necessary and justified when used for emphasis?_

Basically, *four* different visual channels are being used to encode a single data channel here in what is thus a relatively inefficient data graphic that does not support comparison.

And how is **Text** being used ...

* The *ANNOTATION* Test

** _Are visually differentiable *LABELS* used to identify and annotate important features?_
** _visually differentiate label types_

====
* _Chinese cities_ - NOMINAL - SIZE
* _Chinese cities_ - NOMINAL - BRIGHTNESS
* _Hong Kong and Taiwan_ - NOMINAL - ITALICS
====
