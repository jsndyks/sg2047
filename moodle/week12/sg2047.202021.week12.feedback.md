If you have questions, please post them, and discuss them on the <a href="https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=94494">Visualization Discussion Forum</a>.

Here are a few questions that I have been asked recently ... it's important that we share questions and thoughts and answers!

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/k045.bar.png">
<img width=200 src="https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/k045.bar.png"/></a>
</div>

##### Is this bar chart the kind of thing you are looking for?

Errr ... nope, not really.<br/>
Actually, not at all.<br/>

Have a look at this page - particularly the Boroughs section:

- https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381654

See the section that explains why "<i>using SUM ... is unhelpful</i>"

Also, do read the <a href="https://moodle.city.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3030288/mod_assign/introattachment/0/sg2047.coursework2023.task2.v1.pdf?forcedownload=1">Coursework Instructions</a> carefully.

In the section about '**The Data**' you'll see that it says ...

> "_Please focus on the variation across and within the area at LSOA level â€“ by designing effective data dense graphics that show local detail and nuance rather than high-level borough-based comparisons._"

So a bar graph that shows four values for four boroughs doesn't really demonstrate your capabilities for visualizing society.

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week12/img/sg2047.tableau.employmentScatterPlot.png">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/moodle/week12/img/sg2047.tableau.employmentScatterPlot.png"/></a>
</div>

##### My scatter plot has gone wrong - what have I done?

Be sure to think about the variables that you are visualizing.

Can you work out why, in any area, the proportions of _working people who are in full time employment_ ... and the proportions of _working people who are in part-time employment_ might be strongly negatively correlated?

ðŸ˜‰

This doesn't seem too surprising to me.

</div>

##### How you add containers and arrows on your dashboard?

For **containers** and **connectors** (lines) see last week's block on Moodle ... '[Week 11 - Designing Dashboards](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2583550)'

- [https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2583550](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2583550)

Arrows are a bit tricky, I don't have a good answer.<br/>
Well, I didn't.

But _Google_ suggests the following :

- [Arrow Annotations in Worksheets](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/annotations_annotations_add.htm)
- [Adding Graphics to Dashboards](https://www.tableau.com/blog/how-add-illustrations-your-dashboard-and-why-you-should-care-78854)

And it seems to work pretty well.<br/>
There are lots of useful icons that include arrows and other connectors at [FlatIcon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/).
