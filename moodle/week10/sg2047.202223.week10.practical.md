We will be creating a simple linear model this week, and using **Tableau** to do so.
The idea is to :

- get you thinking about (and creating) _simple models_
- show how visualization can be useful in this process by :

  - helping us _select variables_ for modelling;
  - helping us _evaluate_ these simple models - seeing how well they work, and how this varies (geographically and in other ways);
  - helping us think about possible explanations - what are the models missing?

- reinforce some **Tableau** capabilities for _calculation_ and _visualization_
- give you some _analytical capability_ to help with the coursework

### What You Need To Do ...

We're going to work through a practical exercise step-by-step.
But make sure you have watched the _Video Lecture_ [Week 10 - Models & Residuals](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/5efdd0e7-0adc-43da-b13d-a6c8b93bc14a) first.
This will introduce things.

Once you have seen the video, follow along by reading through this page. It will show you some actions in **Tableau** and then ask you to do the same.

The practical is written so that you can go at your own speed if you are using it independently. But it will really help to see the video first. So, if you have not done so, please watch this now!

<!-- <div class='reality'>

#### REALITY CHECK!

Given that we are all working under difficult conditions, I am really keen to try to give you some flexible ways to learn. I don't want anybody to be stressed by learning and expect you all to be able to put very different levels of effort into this activity. So, I need to provide plenty of things for people to do, if they are in circumstances in which this is possible. Equally, some of you will not have the chance to spend time learning. I also understand that some of you will not have computers that enable you to access Tableau. I am still working on a solution for you folks, **Hold tight**.

So, please know that anything at all that you are able to do is a bonus at this stage, and we all need to bear this in mind.

So here are some possible ways of working ...

###### The Absolute Minimum

Just read through this page and watch the video demonstration when you can.
Use any additional time to get up to date with reading.

###### The '_I have Tableau and some time_' Minimum

If you have Tableau and are able to focus on Uni work, then download the data and try out steps 1-4 in Tableau.
Go through it step by step.

###### Extras

If you are in to this and have time to learn, then :
 * try different variables
 * try this out with your LSOA coursework data
 * try the _Links, Tips and Ideas_ listed in Section 5
 * discuss issues on the discussion forum

</div> -->

#### 1. Load the Data ...

First up, we need some data. This is contained in a _Tableau workbook_ that we have created. It is based on the data about London Boroughs (_Local Authorities_) that we have already used, but with a few differences.

We have added a few worksheets to help you with the modelling exercise, and some extra data.

The data relate to the [United Kingdom European Union membership referendum of 2016](http://bit.ly/ukBrexitRef) and provide, on a borough by borough basis ...

- **Total Electorate** - _voters_
- **Turnout** - _proportion of voters who cast a vote (0-1)_
- **Valid Votes** - _number of votes cast_
- **Proportion Leave** - _proportion of voters who voted 'Leave' (0-1)_

Let's get the data ...

- download the [Week 10 - Tableau Workbook (TWBX)](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2381670) from Moodle - <code>census.2011.LA.model.202021.v3.twbx</code>
<!-- **UPDATE** : make sure you have version 3 - <code>census.2011.LA.model.201920.v3.twbx</code> -->
- open the workbook in **Tableau**
- have a look at the '_Data_' tab on the left
- you'll see extra data loaded from '_referendum2016.london.LA.csv_' in the _Tables_ and _Measures_

When you have the data in **Tableau** and have a sense of the new variable names, where they are and what they might be, then continue ...

#### 2. Have a Look at the Leave Data ...

Let's check what the _Leave_ vote looks like ...

<div class='iR'><img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/proportionLeave.png" width=200/></div>

- have a look at the map to see where the people and places of London are - '_map > population density_'
- colour the map according to the '_Proportion Leave_'

You'll find '_Proportion Leave_' in the _Measures_ tab in Tableau, where the two data sets that we have loaded have separate lists of measures. You might need to open the lists to see the measures.

Just drag '_Proportion Leave_' into the colour shelf to encode this variable with colour on the map and reveal the geography of the leave vote.

<div class="q" markdown=1>

###### QUESTION

Do you see any patterns?

- _If so, try to describe the pattern you see._
- _Think about what you know about society in London._

Can you begin to explain the pattern?

</div>

<div class='break'/>

OK - let's look at a different encoding of the leave vote.

- now consider the bar chart '_bar chart > leave_'

<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/london.UKref.barchart.leave.png" width=600/>

In the workbook called '_bar chart > leave_', the bars for each borough show the _proportion leave vote_ through their lengths.
Boroughs are also ordered by _proportion leave vote_ - a double encoding, with **POSITION (Y)** and _LENGTH_ - or **_aligned_ SIZE (X)** both showing _proportion leave vote_.

Bar widths show '_Valid Votes_'. This means that bar **SIZE (2D)** shows us how many people voted leave in each borough. It's hard to compare the widths of the bars as they are not aligned and the bars are so long and thin, but we get an indication - _Bromley_ is a big borough with many voters, _Newham_ is smaller with fewer.

The white vertical line shows the _median_ value of _proportion leave vote_ across boroughs.
The grey shaded area shows the 25th and 75th percentiles.
So the values of 50% of the boroughs fall in the grey shaded area.

Percentiles are easily calculable in **Tableau** - click the _median_ line or _percentile_ bands and select _edit_ to find out more.

<div class="aside" markdown=1>

<div class='iR'><img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/tableauAggregateMenu.jpg" width=150/></div>

###### Aside - Aggregation ...

Tableau is very good at aggregating rows in our data files - using **SUM**, and **AVG** and other functions to summarise a series of rows in our data.
This enables us to group rows in large data files.

But we are not really aggregating or grouping here. We have one row in our data set per borough and are not looking to combine boroughs in our analysis. So we can switch the aggregation features off with the _Analysis_ menu. The same is true of your coursework - _one row per LSOA_.
So no need to aggregate.

This makes some of the names of the graphics a little less confusing.
They will no longer say **SUM** or **AVG** as they are not using a single number to summarise and represent a series of data values.

</div>
<div class='break'/>

#### 3. Let's Try to Explain the Pattern ...

We're now going to try to explain the pattern that we saw with the data.

We'll look at which variables might explain the differences in '_Proportion Leave_' vote by creating a simple _linear model_.

###### i. First - Choose an Explanatory Variable ...

You can _explore_ the data to find census variables that might begin to explain the '_Proportion Leave_' vote. Scatter plots work well here.

By way of example, first we'll look at the proportion of the population with Level 4 qualifications - '<code>k039 PopQ4/Pop16+</code>'

- consider the annotated scatter plot in the worksheet '_scatter plot > regression line_'
- check the correlation between the variables - _<span class='r2'>R<sup>2</sup></span>_ - by mousing over the regression line

<div class="q" markdown=1>

###### QUESTION

What is the correlation between these two variables?<br/>
_Make a record - write it down!_

</div>

<div class="aside" markdown=1>

 <div class='iR'><img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/correlationExplained.png" width=250/></div>

###### Aside - Correlation ...

**NOTE** : If you are unsure what a correlation coefficient measures and how it represents relationships between pairs of variables, then play with _Kristoffer Magnussonâ€™s_ beautiful interactive explanation - [Interpreting Correlations - An Interactive Visualization](https://rpsychologist.com/correlation/)

Actually, have a look anyway and move a few of the data points - it's a lovely interactive exploratory resource that really helps you get familiar with visualizing relationships.

</div>

<div class='break'/>

Now we'll see how other variables correlate with the '_Proportion Leave_' vote ...

- from now on, use the other scatter plot worksheet - '_scatter plot > for editing_'
- add a different explanatory census variable (change the variable encoded in Y as _columns_) and check the correlation - _<span class='r2'>R<sup>2</sup></span>_
- try another - make sure there is a plausible relationship between this variable and voting behaviour
- choose an interesting variable that correlates - has a high _<span class='r2'>R<sup>2</sup></span>_

 <div class='iR'><img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/correlationExplained04.png" width=250/></div>

What's a _high_ _<span class='r2'>R<sup>2</sup></span>_?
Well, there's no sensible answer to that question, it depends on what you are looking for!
Just have a look at the data and the patterns, and think about what you know about correlation. I'm sure you'll find something!

Anything between about **-0.4** and about **0.4** is lowish, so look for something that's greater that about **0.4** (for a positive correlation) or less than about **-0.4** (for a negative correlation).
The further from zero, the stronger the relationship and the better your model will be at explaining the differences in the votes.

And if you want to know what an _<span class='r2'>R<sup>2</sup></span>_ of **0.4** or **-0.4** looks like, try the [Interpreting Correlations - An Interactive Visualization](https://rpsychologist.com/correlation/) resource again!

<div class='break'/>

<div class="q" markdown=1>

###### ACTION

Go through the process described above and select an interesting variable.<br/>
_Write this down too!_

</div>

This variable (the one you just wrote down) will be the basis for your simple linear model.

We'll be looking at how much we can explain the '_Proportion Leave_' vote through this variable and how the relationship changes across London.

###### ii. Then - Create a Simple Linear Model ...

Now we'll see how the variable you have selected can explain the leave vote.

<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/tableau.correlationExplanation.png" width=50% style="padding-left:4em"/>

- click the regression line in the scatter plot to find its description
- right click and select '_Describe Trend Line_'
- copy the '_Equation_', it will look something like ...<br/>
  <code>Avg. Proportion Leave = -0.0101006 \* Avg. k039 PopQ4/Pop16+ + 0.783588</code>

We're going to make a new _measure_ that is based upon this model ...

- create a new measure with '_Create a Calculated Field_' by right clicking in the _Measures_ pane: select '_Create_' and '_Calculated Field_'
- call it '_model VariableName_' with _VariableName_ reflecting your chosen variable
- use the equation of the regression line as the basis of your new calculated field +
  Remember that measure names go in [_square brackets_], e.g.

<img class='iB' src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/tableau.model.create.png" width=400/>

- You can use two forward slashes to add comments to the calculation, and I often use this to paste the equation of the line into the calculation, e.g. put something like this in the calculation box ...<br/>
<pre style="border:1px #d0d0d0 solid; background-color:#fefefe; font-size:80%">// The equation copied from Tableau is ...
// Avg. Proportion Leave = -0.0101006 &#42; Avg. k039 PopQ4/Pop16+ + 0.783588

-0.0101006 â‹‡ <span style="color:#f80">[k039 PopQ4/Pop16+]</span> + 0.783588</pre>

This new measure tells us the proportion of votes we would expect in each borough _if they were exactly predicted by the explanatory variable that you have selected_.

<div class="q" markdown=1>

###### ACTION

Go through this process to create a new Calculated Field that uses this model to 'predict' the Leave vote.

</div>

###### iii. Next - Calculate the Residuals ...

Now we need to find out the differences between the model and the actual leave vote that occurred. Where did the model under-predict and where did it over-predict?
And by how much?

The _residuals_ are just the difference between the thing you are modelling - the _actual proportion of votes cast for leave_ in this instance, and the model - the numbers that your new _Calculated Field_ 'predicts'.

So we just take one from the other:

- (what the model predicts) - (what actually happened)

So if the model says there should be a vote proportion of 50% and we actually got 40%:

- 50 - 40 = 10, so the model over-predicted by 10%

So if the model says there should be a vote proportion of 50% and we actually got 58%:

- 50 - 58 = -8, so the model under-predicted by 8%

Let's use Tableau to do the calculation for all the boroughs:

- create a new measure with '_Create a Calculated Field_'
- call it '_model VariableName_ _residuals_' with _VariableName_ reflecting your chosen variable as above

- calculate the difference between the actual proportion and that calculated by the model, e.g.

<img class='iB' src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/tableau.model.residuals.png" width=400/>

###### iv. Now - Visualize the Residuals ...

We can use the _residuals_ - the differences between our simple imperfect model and the actual number of votes recorded - as a variable.

We can **map** them, colour according to them or create a bar chart using them.

This allows us to see some of the nuances and subtleties associated with our model's predictions and the extent to which they are able to explain the voting patterns in different places.
With any luck it will tell us something about the voting patterns and society in London.

- update the '_residuals_' bar chart with the residuals from your model
- sort the bar chart with the biggest residuals at the top and the lowest at the bottom

 <div class='iR'><img class='iB' src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/tableau.model.residuals.colour.png" width=300/></div>

Now let's add some colour:

- use _Color_, _Edit Colors ..._ to specify a [_diverging_ colour scheme](https://colorbrewer2.org/learnmore/schemes_full.html) around zero so that different hues are used for positive and negative residuals
- use this colour scheme to show the geographic variation in the residuals calculated from your simple linear model by editing the '_residuals_' map

<div class='break'/>

<div class="q" markdown=1>

###### ACTION

Calculate the residuals from your model.
Map them!
See whether they correlate with any other variables - try a scatterplot.

</div>

<div class="aside" markdown=1>

<div class='iR'><img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/html/img/colorBrewer.diverging.png" width=350/></div>

###### Aside - ColorBrewer ...

If you have not been using [ColorBrewer Colour Schemes](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=diverging&scheme=RdYlBu&n=7), explanations and justifications in your work, then now would be a great time to spend some time exploring the [ColorBrewer Website and Guidance](https://colorbrewer2.org/#).

There is great practical advice on how to use what we have learned about data variation and colour in practical and effective ways, and all colour schemes come with _RGB_ values so that you can create them in **Tableau**.

</div>

<div class='break'/>

<div class="q" markdown=1>

###### QUESTION

Can you see any geographic patterns in the residuals?

Your model explains some of the variation in the proportions of leave voters, but does looking at the geography of the residuals help you begin to think about what it is that your model does not capture?

</div>

If you can see geographic patterns, then, this suggests that _processes are operating that are not covered by your model_. So your model does not explain everything ...

This wouldn't be surprising - it's a very simple model - but it's a start, and it helps us explain how one important characteristic of society varies according to another measurable characteristic, and how this relationship itself varies across London.

Maybe this will help you think about what else ,might be going on ... as you continue on the _Exploration Spiral_!

#### 4. Wrapping up ...

That's it!

You can of course try a different model with a different variable as you explore society in London through visualization.

You might use these ideas when looking at the LSOAs - not to explain voting patterns, but to formalise and visualize relationships between aspects of society that you find interesting.

To what extent can you explain variation in one recorded phenomenon through variation in another?And how does this quality of explanation vary across the area you are interested in?

And if you would like to know more, then please consider the page that we have created in Tableau to explain the approaches taken here :

#### 5. Links, Tips and Ideas ...

Finally, here are some useful resources that provide additional information.

They are **not** essential reading / viewing, but may help with some of the _Tableau_ concepts and may interest and help some of you ...
