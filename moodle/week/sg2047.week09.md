Effective use of **containment** and **connection** in graphics can show multiple relationships between people, places and attributes of data sets concurrently. We can also use these techniques to relate multiple graphics in a composite, such as a dashboard. We will consider the use of Layout, Location, Levels and Links to show relationships between individual data items and composite graphics in ways that can help us visualize relationships in society.
We'll look at possibilities and learn through examples in this session â€¦

**PREPARATION**<br/>
Please check the [Week 08 - Homework](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381655) and get on with this before class. It will get you started on [Coursework Task 2 : Design a Data Graphic](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45842#section-17).<br/>

If you have not yet added an image with some findings to the [MS Teams Channel](https://j.mp/sg2047team21) or discussed the graphics that others have made, now would be a good time to participate!
