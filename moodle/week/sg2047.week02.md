We identify the core characteristics of data graphics - their DNA - and consider different encodings between data and visual characteristics to show patterns and reveal structure in data sets â€¦

<!---
**PREPARATION**<br/>
Please make sure you have completed the [Find a Graphic Task](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381602) and have recorded your findings through the [Reporting](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2381603) activity in preparation for this week.<br/>

You also need to complete the [Data Visualization Task Test](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2381604) - twice if possible, with different visualizations.

I will be using your work in this week's lecture so please try to _complete this activity **before Monday**_ ... so I can prepare!
