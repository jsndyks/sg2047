This week we learn about ways to **read** grapohics.

We identify the core characteristics of data graphics - **their DNA** - and consider different _encodings_ between data and the various visual characteristics that allow us to show their patterns and reveal their structure â€¦

<!---
**PREPARATION**<br/>
Please make sure you have completed the [Find a Graphic Task](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381602) and have recorded your findings through the [Reporting](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2381603) activity in preparation for this week.<br/>

You also need to complete the [Data Visualization Task Test](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2381604) - twice if possible, with different visualizations.

I will be using your work in this week's lecture so please try to _complete this activity **before Monday**_ ... so I can prepare!
