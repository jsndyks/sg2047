This page structures the learning activity for Week 11 on _Composite Data Graphics_.

There are **FIVE** sections this week - related activities, focal points and things to do!

We will complete some in class, and others are intended for you to complete in your own time as you build on the concepts and ideas that we have introduced.

Be sure to use the additional explanations and examples below that support some of these sections.

In the session as a whole we'll look at _ways of designing dashboards_ that make use of good practice in graphics to make sense of data through _effective structured visual explanation_.

We'll use examples and draw upon some suggested models for dashboard design and guidelines for good practice.

There will also be some features and capabilities in Tableau that will help you, so that we can all achieve some of this and use it in the coursework assignment.

### 1. What Is a Dashboard?

Well, there are lots of views on this, but here goes!

**My definition - draft 1** :

> A **dashboard** is a collection of graphics, arranged to present information in meaningful ways.

But there's more - we need to _design effective dashboards_ that do this well :

> A **well designed dashboard** will structure and relate graphics in ways that enable patterns to be detected, relationships to be assessed, and comparisons to be made to develop evidence, inform understanding and support action.

Our efforts to _structure_ and _relate_ graphics can involve various aspects of design for _comparison_ :

- location / layout;
- order / sequence;
- containment / hierarchy (levels);
- colour-based association / disassociation;
- alignment (juxtaposition) or superposition;
- connection (links)

###### Dashboard as Composite Graphic ...

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.001.jpeg">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.001.jpeg"/></a>
</div>
Sometimes this will involve a collection of graphics that have similar characteristics, all laid out in a regular pattern.

Here the _encodings_ will be the same for each graphic in the colection, but the _data_ will be different - data for different days, or categories, or places, or products.

_You should be able to think of some examples likes this - collections of graphics that we have seen in the module so far :
**BikeGrid**, **BallotMaps**, **ScatterPlot** Matrices_

<div class="break"/>

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.004.jpeg">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.004.jpeg"/></a>
</div>
Sometimes we will need different encodings, perhaps of the same data to show different aspects, characteristics or relationships.

We may need text and numbers to help with our explanations.

<div class="break"/>

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.005.jpeg">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.005.jpeg"/></a>
</div>

Sometimes we will need to vary the sizes of our graphics so that we can _detect_, _assemble_ and _estimate_ effectively - ensuring that our graphics are _data dense_, but readable.

<div class="break"/>

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.006.jpeg">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.006.jpeg"/></a>
</div>

Often we will need _titles_ and _explanations_ to help draw attention to the important and explain what we are presenting.

<div class="break"/>

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.007.jpeg">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.007.jpeg"/></a>
</div>

It's very useful to add _links_ and _levels_ to our dashboards, with _white space_ and _annotations_, including _containers_ and _connectors_ to help structure the information, show relationships between graphics, and establish _narrative_.

But, if you look back at the definitions, each of these dashboards comply - they just do so in different ways, with different emphases.

<div class="break"/>

<hr class="hrl"/>

###### Dashboard as Operational Overview ...

The term '_dashboard_' was used in the 2000s to describe composite graphics that were intended for operational overview - to see how processes were running in organizations.

For reasons that I don't want to guess at, they often used a _car dashboard_ metaphor and were largely ineffective in terms of what we know about information visualization design.

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://www.staceybarr.com/images/dashboardwithdialsandsliders.png"><img width=300 src="https://www.staceybarr.com/images/dashboardwithdialsandsliders.png"/></a>
</div>

[Stacey Barr](https://www.staceybarr.com/measure-up/why-driving-a-car-is-the-wrong-metaphor-for-business-dashboards/) has a nice example here :

You'll see that this example fails a good many of the _Data Visualization Design Tests_, and hopefully you can think of ways of improving things.

<div class="break"/>

This resulted in lots of efforts to educate dashboard designers from people like [Stephen Few](http://www.stephen-few.com) at [Perceptual Edge](http://www.perceptualedge.com/examples.php). He became pretty famous (in some circles) for this kind of thing and his Website is full of useful resources.

<hr class="hrl"/>

###### Dashboard as Exploratory Instrument ...

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.201920.explore.tableau.jpg">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.201920.explore.tableau.jpg"/></a>
</div>

But dashboards are increasingly used to _explore_ and _investigate_ as well as to monitor.

We have seen some examples that help us try to _find_ relationships, patterns, differences and the like in our data and see how these vary.

They do so be enabling us to get an _Overview_, then focus in with _Zoom &amp; Filter_, and see specific _Details on Demand_ through interaction and iterative encoding.

This results in us hypothesizing about our data, thinking about what it contains, what it might tell us, and asking more questions and doing more explanation in a process that we call _Visual Exploration_.

<div class="break"/>

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.202021.cdvScreenShot.png">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.202021.cdvScreenShot.png"/></a>
</div>

_Visual Exploration_ enables us to make sense of large data sets and see into data in new ways. It offers real opportunities to inform our understanding of complex data.

Using multiple composite graphics to show different aspects of data in different ways concurrently, to support exploration, was the basis of my PhD - I developed the **cdv** software to do this kind of thing - and is now easily achievable in _Tableau_ and other tools.

<div class="break"/>

<hr class="hrl"/>

###### Dashboard as Tableau Feature ...

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.tableauGettingStarted.jpg"/></a>
</div>

And of course _Tableau_ uses the term **_dashboard_** to describe its feature that allows us to combine worksheets (that contain one or more graphics) into composites.

These composite graphics enable us to do _any of the above_ to different degrees. Tableau dashboards are very flexible and hugely enabling. Thankfully, it might be quite difficult to make them look like a car dashboard!
_Don't do this!_

<div class="break"/>

<!-- ##### What are we Trying to Do?

The idea this week, is to get you thinking about some of the considerations involved in making composite graphics.

We can use _Layout_ and _Order_ and _Containers_ and _Connections_ to structure and sequence our graphics according to particular narratives, e.g. :

 * *Detail Narrative* - Overview, Select, Give Details
 * _Geographic Narrative_ - Map-based layout to show how things vary geographically

<div class="break"/>

### 4. Video : Tableau Dashboards &amp; Narrative

Watch the _Tableau Tips_ video so that you can find out how to do some of this stuff in _Tableau_ and use these ideas in the designs that you produce for your coursework.

<div class="iR"><div class="iB">
<a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/a9bef5fb-9c6b-42cb-81bb-1d2587f13786"><img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.dashboards.jpeg"/></a>
</div></div>

You can download the [Example Composite Dashboard](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=1869493) from the Module Homepage and use this after you have watched the video to try things out.

This video contains examples and ideas that will help you produce the kind of dashboard that we are looking for in the Coursework - a dashboard in which you ...

> structure the graphics in ways that enable patterns to be detected, relationships to be assessed, and comparisons to be made to inform understanding and action.

You can download and experiment with the dashboard used in the video, but should also try these ideas in your own dashboards :

### 5. What's Next - Homework, Feedback, Support ...

#### 5.1 Further Guidelines & Good Practice

Check _The Big Book of Dashboards_ to learn more.
You'll have seen it on the [Reading List](https://j.mp/sg2047reading21), where I consider it **Essential Reading** - meaning that all students must read and use it to be able to pass the module.
You can access it all online in digital form.

I'd like you to choose an example from **Part II : The Scenarios** - any of the chapters from 2-29 that look interesting to you.

In each case you'll see a dashboard and a discussion around its design and use.

There are sections in each chapter that explain the _Scenario_ for which the dashboard was designed, _Why This (particular design) Works_ and there is a reflective _Author Commentary_ where the designer thinks about their choices, the degree to which they have been successful and some alternatives.

You can download many of the dashboards as _TWBX_ files from the companion Website :

- [https://www.bigbookofdashboards.com/dashboards.html](https://www.bigbookofdashboards.com/dashboards.html)

This allows you to load them up, edit them, explore them and see how the different designs have been produced.

There is also some useful discussion online too from the book's authors and from Tableau experts _Chris Love_ and _Andy Cotgreave_ :

- [https://www.bigbookofdashboards.com/chartchat.html](https://www.bigbookofdashboards.com/chartchat.html)

I'll leave you to decide how deeply to engage with all of this, but I would like each of you to :

1. Select a Dashboard
2. Read the chapter
3. Identify one or two _principles_ or _guidelines_ that you can draw from this example and apply to your own work

This will help you develop ideas for the coursework, and if you can use these ideas and make reference to this chapter in the coursework then you will be meeting one of the criteria.

For example ...

###### Chapter 24 : Showing Churn or Turnover

<div class="iR"><div class="iB">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.bigBook.24.jpg"><img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.bigBook.24.jpg"/></a>
</div></div>

You'll see various sections on this design including ...

###### Why this works :

The approach is described as _Big Picture & Details_ and involves a composite graphic with :

- Three main areas presenting different levels of detail

  - Overall Picture
  - Comparison
  - Heatmap provides richer details

Use your knowledge of visualization to explain and understand some of these ideas.

Can you use them in your dashboard?
If so - _make explicit reference to them in your design justification_ to support your argument that your design is effective.

###### Author Commentary :

Here, design decisions, limitations and reflection are discussed very nicely in ways that might inform your own designs and reflection. This is the kind of thinking that we want from you when you justify and reflect upon your dashboard and its strengths and weaknesses.

Of course, there is nothing to stop you trying a couple of these chapters!

**But do be sure to try at least one.**

#### 5.2 Feedback - for You!

I will be arranging an open '_Coursework Workshop_' for two hours in the week of **Monday 5th April**.

This is likely to be for **two hours** on _Wednesday Morning_ - but I will confirm later this week.

In addition to my _Open Office_ sessions, this is a chance for **SG2047** students to check in through the [Module Zoom Room](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=1791633), _share screens_, _discuss progress_ and _receive feedback_ on their coursework designs as they develop.

#### 5.3 Feedback - for Me!

I would encourage you to **PLEASE** complete the anonymous module feedback.

It has been hard (but fulfilling and enjoyable) work producing the materials for the module. Just as remote learning is challenging, remote teaching is quite a challenge too!

I have had to be a little creative this year, and have tried a few things out that I have not done before. So I would be very keen to know how things have been for you, to inform my ongoing teaching practice:

- **what worked**? - _what should I retain_?
- **what didn't**? - _what should I drop or work on_?
- **what new ideas should I try out**? - _what has worked well elsewhere_?

Module feedback is very _motivating_ for us, it helps us know what works and what doesn't so - please think this through and put time into giving me some realistic and thoughtful feedback. Your experiences are very informative for me.

I have one specific request:
When asked about the '_Library_' - please consider _the entire range of resources_ : software, Web pages, data, subscriptions, videos, etc.
I would ask you to consider the range of resources that I have made available for the module, as these are not asked about elsewhere.
Thanks!
