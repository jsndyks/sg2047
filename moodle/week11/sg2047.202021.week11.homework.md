Check [The Big Book of Dashboards](https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/535E9DE8-194F-A3E2-7490-341696F2265B.html?lang=en) to learn more.
You'll have seen it on the [Reading List](https://rl.talis.com/3/city/lists/4D152441-27AB-C0A5-5DAD-E23F65978349.html?lang=en), where I consider it **Essential Reading** - meaning that all students must read and use it to be able to pass the module.
You can access it all online in digital form.

I'd like you to choose an example from **Part II : The Scenarios** - any of the chapters from 2-29 that look interesting to you.

In each case you'll see a dashboard and a discussion around its design and use.

There are sections in each chapter that explain the _Scenario_ for which the dashboard was designed, _Why This (particular design) Works_ and there is a reflective _Author Commentary_ where the designer thinks about their choices, the degree to which they have been successful and some alternatives.

You can download many of the dashboards as _TWBX_ files from the companion Website :

- [https://www.bigbookofdashboards.com/dashboards.html](https://www.bigbookofdashboards.com/dashboards.html)

This allows you to load them up, edit them, explore them and see how the different designs have been produced.

There is also some really useful discussion online too from the book's authors and from Tableau experts _Chris Love_ and _Andy Cotgreave_ and various celebrity guests :

- [https://www.bigbookofdashboards.com/chartchat.html](https://www.bigbookofdashboards.com/chartchat.html)

This is an excellent (big!) resource and engaging with it will really get you thinking about graphics and the way that those who produce them graphically think.

I'll leave you to decide how deeply to engage with all of this, but I would like each of you to do the following **as a minimum** :

1. Select a Dashboard
2. Read the chapter
3. Identify one or two _principles_ or _guidelines_ that you can draw from this example and apply to your own work

This will help you develop ideas for the coursework, and if you can use these ideas and make reference to this chapter in the coursework then you will be meeting one of the criteria.

For example ...

###### Chapter 24 : Showing Churn or Turnover

<div class="iR"><div class="iB">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.bigBook.24.jpg"><img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.bigBook.24.jpg"/></a>
</div></div>

You'll see various sections on this design including ...

###### Why this works :

The approach is described as _Big Picture & Details_ and involves a composite graphic with :

- Three main areas presenting different levels of detail

  - Overall Picture
  - Comparison
  - Heatmap provides richer details

Use your knowledge of visualization to explain and understand some of these ideas.

Can you use them in your dashboard?
If so - _make explicit reference to them in your design justification_ to support your argument that your design is effective.

###### Author Commentary :

Here, design decisions, limitations and reflection are discussed very nicely in ways that might inform your own designs and reflection. This is the kind of thinking that we want from you when you justify and reflect upon your dashboard and its strengths and weaknesses.

Of course, there is nothing to stop you trying a couple of these chapters!

**But do be sure to try at least one.**

#### 5.2 Feedback - for You!

I will be arranging an open '_Coursework Workshop_' for two hours in the week of **Monday 5th April**.

This is likely to be for **two hours** on _Wednesday Morning_ - but I will confirm later this week.

In addition to my _Open Office_ sessions, this is a chance for **SG2047** students to check in through the [Module Zoom Room](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=1791633), _share screens_, _discuss progress_ and _receive feedback_ on their coursework designs as they develop.

#### 5.3 Feedback - for Me!

I would encourage you to **PLEASE** complete the anonymous module feedback.

It has been hard (but fulfilling and enjoyable) work producing the materials for the module. Just as remote learning is challenging, remote teaching is quite a challenge too!

I have had to be a little creative this year, and have tried a few things out that I have not done before. So I would be very keen to know how things have been for you, to inform my ongoing teaching practice:

- **what worked**? - _what should I retain_?
- **what didn't**? - _what should I drop or work on_?
- **what new ideas should I try out**? - _what has worked well elsewhere_?

Module feedback is very _motivating_ for us, it helps us know what works and what doesn't so - please think this through and put time into giving me some realistic and thoughtful feedback. Your experiences are very informative for me.

I have one specific request:
When asked about the '_Library_' - please consider _the entire range of resources_ : software, Web pages, data, subscriptions, videos, etc.
I would ask you to consider the range of resources that I have made available for the module, as these are not asked about elsewhere.
Thanks!
