This page structures the learning activity for Week 11 on _Composite Data Graphics_.

There are **FIVE** sections this week - related activities, focal points and things to do!

We will complete some in class, and others are intended for you to complete in your own time as you build on the concepts and ideas that we have introduced.

Be sure to use the additional explanations and examples below that support some of these sections.

In the session as a whole we'll look at _ways of designing dashboards_ that make use of good practice in graphics to make sense of data through _effective structured visual explanation_.

We'll use examples and draw upon some suggested models for dashboard design and guidelines for good practice.

There will also be some features and capabilities in Tableau that will help you, so that we can all achieve some of this and use it in the coursework assignment.

### 1. What Is a Dashboard?
--->

Well, there are lots of views on this, but here goes!

**My definition - Draft 1** :

> A **dashboard** is a collection of graphics, arranged to present information in meaningful ways.

But there's more - we need to _design effective dashboards_ that do this well.

**My definition - Draft 2** :

> A **well designed dashboard** will structure and relate graphics in ways that enable patterns to be detected, relationships to be assessed, and comparisons to be made in order to develop evidence, inform understanding and support action.

Our efforts to _structure_ and _relate_ graphics can involve various aspects of design for _comparison_ :

- location / layout;
- order / sequence;
- containment / hierarchy (levels) for association / dissociation;
- colour-based association / dissociation;
- alignment (juxtaposition) or superposition;
- connection (links) for association and annotation

###### Dashboard as Composite Graphic ...

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.001.jpeg">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.001.jpeg"/></a>
</div>
Sometimes this will involve a collection of graphics that have similar visual characteristics, all laid out in a regular pattern.

Here the _encodings_, the _DNA_, will be the same for each graphic in the collection, but the _data_ will be different - data for different days, or categories, or places, or products.

To be effective, the _layout_ used to _position_, _align_ and _relate_ the graphics will help with comparison tasks.

<!-- 
_You should be able to think of some examples likes this - collections of graphics that we have seen in the module so far :
**BikeGrid**, **BallotMaps**, **ScatterPlot** Matrices_
 -->

<div class="break"/>

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.004.jpeg">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.004.jpeg"/></a>
</div>
Sometimes we will need different encodings, perhaps of the same data to show different aspects, characteristics or relationships, or to help with different visualization tasks.

Maybe the _scales_ that we use differ as the data in each of our graphics has different _ranges_?

We may need text and numbers to help with our explanations.

<div class="break"/>

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.005.jpeg">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.005.jpeg"/></a>
</div>

Sometimes we will need to vary the sizes of our graphics so that we can _detect_, _assemble_ and _estimate_ effectively - ensuring that our graphics are _data dense_, but readable.

If one of your graphics is particularly important, maybe it's the sum or average of all activity, or fails the _detection_ test, then you may want to make it bigger so that it is interpretable and emphasized.

<div class="break"/>

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.006.jpeg">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.006.jpeg"/></a>
</div>

Often we will need _titles_ and _explanations_ to help draw attention to the important and explain what we are presenting.

Visual explanations rely upon guiding the reader into the data - make sure readers see in the data what you saw in the data.

Titles, labels, annotations, leader lines, arrows, containers, shaded areas are all important here.

<div class="break"/>

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.007.jpeg">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.lecture.007.jpeg"/></a>
</div>

It's very useful to add _links_ and _levels_ to our dashboards, with _white space_ and _annotations_, including _containers_ and _connectors_ to help structure the information.
This allows us to show relationships between graphics directly, and establish _narrative_.

But, if you look back at the definitions, each of these dashboards comply - they just do so in different ways, with different emphases.

###### Dashboard as Operational Overview ...

The term '_dashboard_' was used in the 2000s to describe composite graphics that were intended for operational overview - to see how processes were running in organizations.

For reasons that I don't want to guess at, they often used a _car dashboard_ metaphor and were largely ineffective in terms of what we know about information visualization design.

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://www.staceybarr.com/images/dashboardwithdialsandsliders.png"><img width=300 src="https://www.staceybarr.com/images/dashboardwithdialsandsliders.png"/></a>
</div>

[Stacey Barr](https://www.staceybarr.com/measure-up/why-driving-a-car-is-the-wrong-metaphor-for-business-dashboards/) has a nice example here :

You'll see that this example fails a good many of the _Data Visualization Design Tests_, and hopefully you can think of ways of improving things.

<div class="break"/>

This resulted in lots of efforts to educate dashboard designers from people like [Stephen Few](https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/author/B001H6IQ5M) at [Perceptual Edge](http://www.perceptualedge.com/examples.php).
Few became pretty famous (in some circles) for this kind of thing and his Website is full of useful guidance and resources.

<hr class="hrl"/>

###### Dashboard as Exploratory Instrument ...

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.201920.explore.tableau.jpg">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.201920.explore.tableau.jpg"/></a>
</div>

But dashboards are increasingly used to _explore_ and _investigate_ as well as to monitor.

We have seen some examples that help us try to _find_ relationships, patterns, differences and the like in our data and see how these vary.

They do so be enabling us to get an _Overview_, then focus in with _Zoom &amp; Filter_, and see specific _Details on Demand_ through interaction and iterative encoding.

This results in us hypothesizing about our data, thinking about what it contains, what it might tell us, and asking more questions and doing more explanation in a process that we call _Visual Exploration_.

<div class="break"/>

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.202021.cdvScreenShot.png">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047.202021.cdvScreenShot.png"/></a>
</div>

_Visual Exploration_ enables us to make sense of large data sets and see into data in new ways. It offers real opportunities to inform our understanding of complex data.

Using multiple composite graphics to show different aspects of data in different ways concurrently, to support exploration, was the basis of my PhD - I developed the **cdv** software to do this kind of thing - and is now easily achievable in _Tableau_ and other tools.

<div class="break"/>

<hr class="hrl"/>

###### Dashboard as Tableau Feature ...

<div class="iR">
<a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started">
<img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/sg2047-1920-week11.tableauGettingStarted.jpg"/></a>
</div>

And of course _Tableau_ uses the term **_dashboard_** to describe its feature that allows us to combine worksheets (that contain one or more graphics) into composites.

These composite graphics enable us to do _any of the above_ to different degrees. Tableau dashboards are very flexible and hugely enabling. Thankfully, it might be quite difficult to make them look like a car dashboard!
_Don't do this!_
