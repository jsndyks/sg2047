#### The Task 

Your task is to demonstrate your knowledge of visualization by selecting an online data graphic and assessing it through a structured description & commentary based upon a standard template.

This individual piece of assessed coursework work will account for **30%** of your module mark.

**Instructions** are attached to this assignment area - have a look at the **PDF**.

**Rubric** and grading details are available when you click '**Add submission**' and in a table on this [Coursework- Task 1 : Rubric](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824737) page.<br/>
Study the criteria that are required for particular marks to inform your approach.

You will be marked on:

 - the quality of your **DNA** table - show that you understand the encodings in the graphic;
 - your use of the **Data Vis Design Tests** and application of these ideas to assess the graphic, and;
 - your **Selection** of an appropriate graphic that passes some tests and fails others.
