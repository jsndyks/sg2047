|Grade|DNA 40%|Tests 40%|Selection 20%|
|--:|---|--|--|
|**EXCELLENT**<br/>**85%**|Data channels and visual variables are fully identified and correctly described, along with plausible levels of variation and details.<br/>Guidance is used very effectively.<br/>No important omissions or errors are evident.<br/>Some complexity in the graphic is described.|The inter-relationships between Data Visualization Design Tests and trade-offs that take place in design have been understood in highly convincing discussion that demonstrates depth of knowledge.|The highest marks are reserved for selected graphics that are data dense and relational, meet all criteria, pass some of the Data Visualization Design Tests but not others, and that involve some novelty or sophistication that make describing the DNA challenging and suggestions for improvement possible.
|**VERY GOOD**<br/>**75%**|Data channels and visual variables are fully identified and correctly described, along with plausible levels of variation and details.<br/>Guidance is applied and used well.|The Data Visualization Design Tests are used to critique the graphic and make suggestions for improvement in an informative and well informed set of comments and discussion. Arguments that some tests are passed and some failed are credible.|The selected graphic is data dense and relational. It meets all criteria and passes some of the Data Visualization Design Tests but not others.
|**GOOD**<br/>**65%**|Many of the data dimensions and visual variables are correctly identified, along with levels of variation, with few omissions or errors.<br/>Guidance is applied and used well on the whole.|A variety of Data Visualization Design Tests are selected and the comments and discussion show that they have been well understood on the whole and used to assess the graphic.|The selected graphic is data dense and relational - it passes the DENSITY and COMPARISON tests by presenting many numbers in a small space and clearly relating more than two data channels (variables).
|**FAIR**<br/>**55%**|Most data dimensions are identified, levels of variation are largely correct.<br/>Visual variables are correctly described in most cases.<br/>Guidance is used appropriately in places.<br/>Errors and omissions are minor.|A variety of Data Visualization Design Tests are selected and the comments and discussion show that they have been reasonably well understood, to assess the graphics.<br/>A few errors, omissions ands misinterpretations are expected.|The selected graphic is not data dense AND relational - it does not pass the DENSITY or COMPARISON tests [by] presenting many numbers in a small space and being evidently relational and multivariate.
|**SATISFACTORY**<br/>**45%**|Some data dimensions identified, levels of variation are largely correct.<br/>Visual variables are correctly described in some cases and guidance is used.<br/>Some errors and omissions are evident.|Four valid Data Visualization Design Tests are selected and some of these seem to be understood.<br/>Others may have been misinterpreted.|The selected graphic is not data dense AND relational but is openly available through a publicly accessible URL and presented in the SELECTION table of the submitted document.
|**POOR**<br/>**35%**|Incomplete or erroneous description with sufficient mistakes, omissions and inconsistencies to suggest important misunderstandings.|While some Data Visualization Design Tests are used to assess the graphics, sufficient mistakes, omissions and inconsistencies suggest limited knowledge and reveal important misunderstandings.|The selected graphic is not appropriate. It is not multivariate (failing the COMPARISON test) and does not show many data items (failing the DENSITY test).
|**VERY POOR**<br/>**25%**|Incomplete or erroneous description with sufficient mistakes, omissions and inconsistencies to suggest many  serious misunderstandings.|Significant omissions, or misunderstandings in interpreting and applying the Data Visualization Design Tests are evident.<br/>The table may be incomplete.|The selected graphic is not appropriate. It is not multivariate (failing the COMPARISON test) and does not show many data items (failing the DENSITY test).<br/>It is likely to involve trivial design or not be evidently based upon data.
|**VERY POOR**<br/>**15%**<br/>(discretionary)|Despite a valid submission, it's not clear that you are able to identify the DNA of a data graphic.|It's not clear that you understand the Data Visualization Design Tests or the concepts that underlie them or can use them in your assessment of the quality and DNA of a data graphic.|A highly inappropriate graphic.
|**OMITTED**<br/>**5%**|No DNA description|No use of tests of excellence|No graphic is provided
