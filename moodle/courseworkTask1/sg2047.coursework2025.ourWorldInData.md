### Our World in Data

The amazing [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/#entries) project aims to use _research_, _data_ and _visualization_ of the data to address some of the World's most pressing problems.

The resources produced since 2005 contain thousands of charts.

This is a great source of interesting and informative efforts to visualize aspects of society.

I'd like you to look through the reports and find a chart, or data graphic, that you can assess for [Coursework Task 1](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=824736).

Here's what you need to do:

1. [Browse by Topic](https://ourworldindata.org/), check the [Latest Articles](https://ourworldindata.org/latest) and consult the [Data Explorers](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers) to find a topic and graphic that seem interesting to you. <br/>
   You'll find lots of themed resources that address important topics. <br/>
   And there are [thousands of data graphics](https://ourworldindata.org/charts)

2. Consider the graphics, and think about their **DNA** and **Design**. <br/>
   Do so in light of your learning so far, the _Task 1 Instructions and Rubric_ and the _Data Visualization Design Tests_ (sometimes termed, _HeurVIStics_!).

3. Interact with the graphics - you can change the data that are shown and the way that they look in many cases.

4. Choose a graphic as the focus of your coursework activity.

5. Check the [Coursework - Task 1 : Selected Data Graphics](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=824739). <br/>
   Make sure that the graphic you have chosen has not already been selected by a colleague. <br/>
   **If so - you'll need to choose a different one.**

6. When you have found a suitable graphic that has not been chosen by somebody else ...<br/>
   Log the graphic that you have selected in the page listing the [Coursework - Task 1 : Selected Data Graphics](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=824739).

#### Logging and Saving Graphics - Easy with Icons

Many of the graphics contain icons that help save a version of the graphic.
This makes logging your selected graphic pretty easy.

There is an interesting example on the [Cumulative number of objects launched into space](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space?country=OWID_WRL~USA~RUS~CHN~GBR~JPN~FRA~IND~DEU~European+Space+Agency) over the years.

You'll see a few options and a **link logo** underneath it.

This is the **link logo** ...
![link](https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/link.logo.png)

Click it and select **Copy Link** to copy the URL of the graphic.

You should be able to paste directly into the [Coursework - Task 1 : Selected Data Graphics](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=824739) spreadsheet.

Use **Paste Special** to only paste the values (the URL) and not the format.
<code>CTRL-SHIFT-V</code> should do this on a PC - or <code>COMMAND-SHIFT-V</code> if you are using a Mac.

It might look something like this :

- <code>https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/measles-cases-and-death-rate?time=1967..2015</code>

You can download a static copy (an image) of the graphic by clicking the download logo ...
![link](https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/sg2047/download.logo.png)

Click it and select **Save as .png** to download an image of the graphic that you can put in your coursework submission.

#### Logging and Saving Graphics - Quite Easy Anyhow!

Not all of the graphics have these helpful icons.
I think the ones without are probably the older ones.

<!-- 
For example, this one on [Global Causes of Child Death per Year](https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination#global-decline-in-vaccine-preventable-diseases)

<img width="80%" style="padding-left:10%;padding-right:10%" src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/04/Reduction-of-child-deaths-due-to-vaccine-preventable-diseases-2019.png"/>
 -->

It's still pretty straightforward to record the graphic and save a copy to your own computer.

1. Make the graphic as big as you can - perhaps by clicking it
2. **Right Click** on the image to save it locally to your own computer. <br/>
   _Check that you have saved the correct image by finding it on your computer and opening it up._
3. Copy the **URL** at the top of the browser to record its location <br/>
   _This starts with **http://** or **https://**_ <br/>
   _This should end with **png** or **gif** or **jpg** or **jpeg** depending on the type of image._ <br/>
   _Any of these is fine._
4. Check that you have the **URL** saved correctly. <br/>
   It will be something like this : <br/>
   <code>https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination#global-decline-in-vaccine-preventable-diseases</code><br/>
   _You could paste it into another browser or email it to a friend to see whether they can access the image._

But ... in all honesty, choosing a graphic with a download logo saves you some hassle!
