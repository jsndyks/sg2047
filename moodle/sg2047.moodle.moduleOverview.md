### Summary Description

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/sg2047/sg2047.css">

Data is everywhere: in the media and news, in political and policy debate, in advertising and in social research. Visual representations of data abound â€“ in the press, on web sites and as important tools for use in understanding data at a number of levels in both the physical and social sciences.

Before the COVID outbreak **Prof. Jim Hollan** of _UC San Diego_ put is succinctly

> "_Visualization is fundamental to meeting the unprecedented challenges and exploiting the wonderful opportunities of the ever-expanding deluge of data confronting virtually every field_".

Since the COVID outbreak our use of data day by day, to assess risk and inform behaviour and policy, has been heightened.

**This module helps you develop _a visual approach to using data in social science_.**

- It introduces and synthesizes research in cognitive science, computer science and the geo-sciences and accounts for developing practice in design.
- It will help you interpret graphical representations of data as you make sense of data through graphics.
- It will help you design meaningful and useful graphics to explore data sets and understand them, and to explain data sets as you communicate your findings to others.

The module is data led and will involve you using industry standard software to produce graphics of selected data sets that are relevant to social science.

You will design and develop graphics that show broad structure and subtle nuance in the data sets that you select by engaging with best practice in graphical design, considering ways in which visualization designers have approached data design challenges and engaging in critique and redesign.

### Aims

This module aims to ...

- establish principles of graphical design and levels of graphical literacy;
- enable you to critique graphics and develop plausible visualization through a process of description, self-critique and redesign;
- ensure that you are able to use appropriate software to effectively visualize data sets that describe society in a variety of ways;

### Learning Outcomes

In order to be awarded credit having successfully completed the module, you will need to show that you can ...

1.  **explain** - _the appropriate use of visual marks and their characteristics_ - in graphical depictions of data
2.  **design** - _graphics of a range of data types_ - that represent aspects of society effectively and appropriately
3.  **use** - _visualization software_ - to produce meaningful graphics of society
4.  **demonstrate** - _a critical approach_ - to the evaluation of visualization
5.  **apply** - _established knowledge of perception and principles of design_ - in designing and critiquing graphics
6.  **value** - _established knowledge of perception and principles of design_ - in designing and critiquing graphics

You should use these six outcomes as a benchmark against which you check your progress and plan your learning.
Make sure you understand them, check them every couple of weeks or so to make sure that you are on track.
Routinely check whether you can do these things, whether you are doing these things, whether you need help in doing these things.

### Teaching &amp; Learning

Teaching and learning activities will be organised to help you achieve these outcomes.
Everything that I plan, discuss and ask you to do is intended to help you achieve these six things listed above.
So please follow the plan closely!

You will participate in weekly classes that contain **lectures**, in which ideas and examples will be introduced, and interactive **practical sessions** in which you will gain hands on experience of visualization systems and problems. These are interspersed a little in the 2 hour sessions on Tuesdays.

Examples will be used throughout the module so that you are able to see how data is visualized in a range of contexts including academic work, government, industry and in developing and communicating policy.

Sources of additional reading will be provided through the [Module Reading List](http://readinglists.city.ac.uk/modules/sg2047/lists/2022-23) to consolidate the information provided during lectures. Directed reading and other activity will be provided for reading week. This reading, and the examples we consider will be used to inform a series of _Data Visualization Design Tests_ or _HeurVIStics_ that we will use to inform our visualization work as the module progresses.
You will be able to use these as a lens through which to interpret and evaluate data graphics, and to guide design decisions when you are visualizing data.

You will identify, evaluate and develop _visualization designs_ throughout the module and will spend time in class using industry standard software to do so.

The coursework involves developing a design to _visualize society_. You will receive formative feedback on your design in a coursework workshop prior to its submission, enabling you to _redesign_ in light of feedback and critique.

The module will be taught over one term. Particular emphasis is placed on active hands-on learning and students will be provided with a range of hands-on tasks, visualization challenges and data sets.

### Indicative Content

You can find titles and descriptions of each of the ten sessions on the [Module Homepage](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45842).

### Reading and Resources

An annotated [Module Reading List](http://readinglists.city.ac.uk/modules/sg2047/lists/2022-23) includes links to books, blogs, online resources and selected journal articles - most of which are openly accessible in digital form through University subscriptions. Module texts that are relevant across the module and will help with the assessment are also listed.

This consists of ...

- **ESSENTIAL READING**
  These are the sources that you really need to read and know well. I recommend reading them early in the course to inform your learning, and suggest you read them before the end of reading week (week 06).You will have coursework to complete by then too - so the earlier the better!

- **RECOMMENDED READING**
  I recommend these sources to help provide detail, explanations and examples around many of the core concepts that are introduced. These are valuable sources that provide depth that will support the introductions provided in class. All are available digitally online through our library subscriptions. Decide which source piques your interest ... read through, take notes, and use the knowledge, concepts and ideas to inform your thinking and approach to visualization ...

- **REFERENCE MATERIAL**
  Other sources that you will find useful and to which you should have access - use these books and web sites to support your learning on the module ...

We will be using the **Tableau Desktop** software for visualization. The software is installed on computers in the University and available to students for use off campus through the company's _Academic Program_.
Support on accessing and installing the software is provided on the [Module Homepage](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45842).

### Assessment

The [Module Assessment](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2381579) will give you the opportunity to show whether you have achieved the intended module learning outcomes (we give you credit if you have!) and if so, the extent to which this is the case (we give more marks for higher levels of achievement).

Assessment will involve two components:

1.  the structured evaluation of a selected data graphic design - submitted at the end of reading week, and
2.  a data graphic that visualizes society - submitted after the end of term along with a justification and critique of the design that reflects on feedback provided in class.

The coursework is weighted 30:70 between these two components.

The pass mark for the module is **40%**.

<!---
There are no minimum qualifying marks for specific assessments.
  --->

All students who fail the assessment are permitted a re-sit, with marks capped at 40% - see your programme documentation for details.

Should any extenuating circumstances compromise your ability to study then you should report them promptly in accordance with University procedures for dealing with [Extenuating Circumstances](https://www.city.ac.uk/student-administration/if-things-go-wrong/extenuating-circumstances). Circumstances accepted through this process can be considered by the Board of Assessment during its decision making.

Please use this process if you are unable to study as well as you would like for reasons beyond your control. It's there to help you during difficult time s, and to enable us to assess you fairly in line with your capability.

### Learning and Engagement

I love to work with motivated, engaged, enquiring students - so please think through the subjects that are introduced in class, ask questions and suggest answers.

I'd love to inspire you in your use of data and graphics, but would also like to be inspired by you too!

It works well if you prepare for class by keeping up to date with the essential and recommended reading, and do any preparation listed on Moodle. Please come to class as informed active participants in the module.

Please also arrive for lessons **in good time** - it is disruptive to staff and fellow students if you arrive late.
Be punctual, informed and ready to learn. Take notes, ask questions, express concerns, share ideas and challenge teaching staff.

This is a module in which some creativity is required - so be bold in developing and justifying solutions and try to enjoy the challenges and opportunities associated with _Visualizing Society_.

I look forward to meeting you and learning with you.
