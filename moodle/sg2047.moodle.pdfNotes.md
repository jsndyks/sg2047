I was asked about using the PDFs to take notes, and how you might go about doing this.<br/>
Here are _a few ideas_ that might get you started.<br/>
Take time to explore the options and use them well - these will be essential to your studies.

## Taking Notes with PDFs

So how do you annotated PDFs and use them to take notes?

Well - you could use the **printed copies** and annotate with a pen directly on the paper. Many of us love using pen and pencil, but the notes are not searchable.

So, a _digital mechanism_ for annotation, in which you can search notes and use tags to organise your annotations, makes a lot of sense.<br/>
There are lots of options, and it's well worth investing some time in exploring a few of these, finding one that works, and using this effectively to support your studies.

### Google Drive

If you upload PDFs to a folder on your **Google Drive** you can highlight sections and add comments. These are searchable and editable and sharable. So you can develop discourse with yourself (!) or others around the notes.

### Microsoft Edge

The Windows machines in the labs have 'Edge' and this comes on most Windows computers. Opening a PDF in **Edge** gives you options to highlight and annotate and save your notes in the PDF.

### Mac Preview

On Macs, the **Preview** viewer that comes with MacOS does similar things. You can add text, comments, highlights and various shapes to the PDF as you annotate.

### Acrobat Reader

_Adobe_ have produced a free reader for PDFs, _Acrobat Reader_, which contains a small subset of the functionality available in its _Acrobat_ software suite. This includes annotation and note-taking facilities.

It offers much the same functionality as _Preview_ and _Edge_ and is available on the Windows machines in the City labs.

If you want to use _Acrobat_, which is pretty powerful, then this is available via _Self-Service_

### GoodNotes

A nice note-taking app that runs on Macs and Windows is [**GoodNotes**](https://www.goodnotes.com/). Many of my colleagues us it for drawing and sketching. It works well on iPads, but runs on Windows machines too.

As I understand it, it will only take one page of a PDF at a time, so you may need to open the PDF with another application ðŸ‘† and copy and paste pages in.

But it may be worth considering using note-taking software such as GoodNotes during your studies and it seems worth a try.

Consider [**Notability**](https://notability.com/), which is another similar option.

### PowerPoint

I won't be circulating **PowerPoint** slide decks as the copies I use for presentations are full of notes and hidden slides and dead ends and animations all sorts of stuff that makes no sense and that you don't need to see.

---

The whole idea of the PDF is to give you a structured and clean set of slides that you can use for memory, annotation and to structure your thinking around the subjects, ideas and concepts that we cover.

Hopefully some experimentation with the above, will help you find a way of using the PDFs effectively.

If you have views on these solutions of have found alternatives then do feel free to share and discuss ideas on the [Visualization Discussion](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=94494) forum.

## Taking Notes with Web Pages

So much for PDFs!

But you can add annotations to Web pages, which is a very useful thing to be able to do.

### hypothes.is

Why not consider [**hypothes.is**](https://web.hypothes.is/) to help you take notes during your studies?

It allows you to annotate Web pages (including those on Moodle) with notes, comments and highlights that can be private or shared among groups. You could set up study groups to share annotations with friends and colleagues.

<img width="80%" style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:10%; border:1px #f0f0f0 solid; padding:2px" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/img/hypothes.is.png"/>

It doesn't seem to work particularly well with PDFs, but for other documents, it has impressive potential.
