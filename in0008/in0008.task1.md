### 1. Tableau Basics

You can't really break Tableau, it's robust, so please don't be scared of it!

But it is powerful software with hundreds of options, so it can be a bit confusing and it's easy to get lost. We all get lost. Jason gets lost, Marjahan gets lost ... you will also get lost. But that's part of the fun of it all.<br/>
Here are some important ground rules to help you get lost less often, and get un-lost when it does!

1. **SAVE regularly** - with <code>File</code>, <code>Save As ...</code>, <code>Tableau Packaged Workbook (TWBX)</code>, giving your workbook new names as you make progress: v1, v2, v3, etc.

1. **use the <code>UNDO</code> button** - repeatedly pressing <code>UNDO</code> should get you back to something familiar if you go wrong
1. **ask someone** - _Jason_ and _Marjahan_ are around to help. Just yell "_Help Jason!_" or "_Help Marjahan!_" and we will.
