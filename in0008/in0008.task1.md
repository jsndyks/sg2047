### IN0008 - Data Design Hackathon - Visual Analytics

<!---
##### Instructions for the task in which you use a **Tableau** workbook to _describe_ your station and _compare_ it with others using _Visual Analytics_.
You will begin to _make suggestions_ as to how TfL might improve the scheme.

### 1. Tableau Ground Rules

You can't really break Tableau, it's robust, so please don't be scared of it!

But it is powerful software with hundreds of options, so it can be a bit confusing and it's easy to get lost. We all get lost. Jason gets lost, Marjahan gets lost ... you will also get lost. But that's part of the fun of it all.<br/>

Here are some important **ground rules** to help you get lost less often, and get un-lost when it does!

**PLEASE READ THEM AND FOLLOW THEM**

1. **SAVE regularly** - with <code>File</code>, <code>Save As ...</code>, <code>Tableau Packaged Workbook (TWBX)</code>, giving your workbook new names as you make progress: v1, v2, v3, etc.

2. **UNDO regularly** - use the <code>UNDO</code> button to get back to where you were earlier! Use it repeatedly. Pressing <code>UNDO</code> many times (and perhaps <coed></code> if you overshoot) should get you back to something familiar if you go wrong.

3. **DUPLICATE worksheets** - _RIGHT click_ on a worksheet at the bottom of the _Tableau_ window and <code>Duplicate</code> to effectively save a useful worksheet and have a copy that you can change further.

4. **NAME worksheets** - spend time giving your worksheets sensible, informative, reasonable names: not _worksheet 1_, _worksheet 2_, _Frank_, _Rizzo_, _temp_ and things like that.<br/>(_Rizzo is my cat - it's always a bad idea to name files and worksheets after your pets_ ðŸ™€)

5. **SAVE regularly** - with <code>File</code>, <code>Save As ...</code>, <code>Tableau Packaged Workbook (TWBX)</code> - remember?

6. **Don't change the ROWS and COLUMNS in the first three worksheets** - duplicate these and play with new versions of the worksheets if you want to change things.

7. **ASK someone** - _Jason_ and _Marjahan_ are around to help.<br/>We may have other teachers in class too.<br/>Just yell "_Help Jason!_" or "_Help Marjahan!_" and we will soon be running along to advise you!

8. **DOWNLOAD a fresh copy** - If all goes badly wrong, and this sometimes happens to all of us, just start again. Grab the [Data - Tableau Workbook](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2554492) from ðŸ‘ˆ this link.<br/>You'll soon be back where you were and will have learned plenty in the process.

### 2. Tableau Visual Analytics

OK, that's the ground rules sorted, not for the things that you can do to work on the _Data Design_ challenges that you have been set.

Remember that we are asking you to use **Tableau** to ...

- **describe** your station
- **compare** your station with a colleague
- **compare** stations in your group / area
- **describe** your group / area

Here are some possibilities that you should experiment with to help you do that through _Visual Analytics_ ...

##### SELECT - Use the FILTER Shelf to Select Your Station and Area of Interest

<div class="imgR">
<img width=150 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/tableau.filter.png"/>
</div>

Click to select from the list and limit the data that is displayed in the worksheet to your particular focus.

<div class="clrR"/>

##### EMPHASIZE - Use the HIGHLIGHTER Shelf to Visually Emphasize Selected Data Items

<div class="imgR">
<img width=150 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/tableau.highlight.png"/>
</div>

Type data values to see them related data items in your worksheets.<br/>
Experiment!

<div class="clrR"/>

##### RE-DESIGN - Use the Marks Shelf to Change What You See

Dragging variables from the _Data Shelf_ onto the _Marks Shelf_ allows you see the data set in different ways. Experiment!

<div class="imgR" style="padding:2px; margin-left:10%; border:1px solid #f0f0f0">
<video width="200" height="150" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/tableau.marksCard.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

Clicking any of the items on the _Marks Shelf_ gives you all sorts of options. Try them out.

Remember to <code>Save</code> regularly and <code>UNDO</code> when something unexpected happens!

<div class="clrR"/>

##### ANNOTATE - Add Annotations to Identify Interesting Features

You are attempting to _describe_ and _compare_ and will need to make notes. Use _annotations_ to make notes about the data in the graphic.

##### DUPLICATE - Make Copies of Worksheets as You Make Progress

##### CREATE - Save An Image When You See Something Interesting

You will need to do this for your submission and presentation.

<code>Worksheet</code>,<code>Export &gt;</code>,<code>Image ...</code>, <code>Save ...</code>
