### IN0008 - Data Design Hackathon - Visual Analytics

<!---
##### Instructions for the task in which you use a **Tableau** workbook to _describe_ your station and _compare_ it with others using _Visual Analytics_.
You will begin to _make suggestions_ as to how TfL might improve the scheme.

### 1. Tableau Ground Rules

You can't really break Tableau, it's robust, so the first rule is:

- **Please don't be scared of it!**<br/>Just enjoy using it and finding out about it

But it is powerful software with hundreds of options, so it can be a bit confusing and it's easy to get lost. We all get lost. _Jason_ gets lost, _Marjahan_ gets lost ... you will also get lost. But that's part of the fun of it all.<br/>

Here are some important **ground rules** to help you get lost less often, and get un-lost when it does!

**PLEASE READ THEM AND FOLLOW THEM**

1. **SAVE regularly** - with <code>File</code>, <code>Save As ...</code>, <code>Tableau Packaged Workbook (TWBX)</code>, giving your workbook new names as you make progress: v1, v2, v3, etc.

<img height="58" width="266" style="padding-left:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/tableau.file_saveas_twbx.png"/>

2. **UNDO regularly** - use the <code>UNDO</code> button to get back to where you were earlier! Use it repeatedly. Pressing <code>UNDO</code> many times (and perhaps <code>REDO</code> if you overshoot) should get you back to something familiar _if_ (make that **WHEN**) you go wrong.

<img height="40" width="80" style="padding-left:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/tableau.undo-redo.png"/>

3. **DUPLICATE worksheets** - _RIGHT click_ on a worksheet at the bottom of the _Tableau_ window and <code>Duplicate</code> to effectively save a useful worksheet and have a copy that you can change further.

4. **NAME worksheets** - spend time giving your worksheets sensible, informative, reasonable names: not _worksheet 1_, _worksheet 2_, _Frank_, _Rizzo_, _temp_ and things like that.<br/>(_Rizzo is my cat - it's always a bad idea to name files and worksheets after your pets_ üôÄ)

5. **SAVE regularly** - with <code>File</code>, <code>Save As ...</code>, <code>Tableau Packaged Workbook (TWBX)</code> - remember? üëÜ

6. **Don't change the ROWS and COLUMNS in the first three worksheets** - duplicate these and play with new versions of the worksheets if you want to change things.

<img height="64" width="435" style="padding-left:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/tableau.rows-columns.png"/>

7. **ASK someone** - _Jason_ and _Marjahan_ are around to help.<br/>We may have other teachers in class too.<br/>Just yell "_Help Jason!_" or "_Help Marjahan!_" and we will soon be running along to advise you!<br/>
   But - ask your colleagues too. See whether you can work out how to make the software do what you want it to by experimenting, communicating and working collectively withing your group or at your particular table / desk. There are only tow teachers here, but almost 100 students - that's a lot of intellect and person power! Use it.

8. **DOWNLOAD a fresh copy** - If all goes badly wrong and this sometimes happens to all of us sometimes, and people power doesn't save the day, well ... üòµ‚Äçüí´ ... just start again.
   <br/>Grab the [Data - Tableau Workbook](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2554492) from üëà this link and open a fresh workbook.
   <br/>It's not the end of The World and it happens to all of us. You'll soon be back where you were and will have learned plenty in the process.

### 2. Tableau Visual Analytics Guidance

OK, that's the ground rules sorted, not for the things that you can do to work on the _Data Design_ challenges that you have been set.

Remember that we are asking you to use **Tableau** to ...

- **describe** your station
- **compare** your station with a colleague
- **compare** stations in your group / area
- **describe** your group / area

Here are some possibilities that you should experiment with to help you do that through _Visual Analytics_.

As you work through them, watch the movies and try **Tableau** you should be learning about **Tableau** functionality, learning about _the data_, learning about your _station_ and your _area_ and beginning to _describe_ and _compare_.

Remember ...<br/>üëÜ the **ground rules**, as you<br/>üëá work your way through these features and this _Visual Analytics Guidance_ ...

##### SELECT - Use the FILTER Shelf to Select Your Station and Area of Interest

<div class="imgR">
<img width=150 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/tableau.filter.png"/>
</div>

Click to select from the list and limit the data that is displayed in the worksheet to your particular focus.

<div class="clrR"/>

##### EMPHASIZE - Use the HIGHLIGHTER Shelf to Visually Emphasize Selected Data Items

<div class="imgR">
<img width=150 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/tableau.highlight.png"/>
</div>

Type _data values_ to see the related data items in your worksheets.<br/>
These will be _highlighted_ and other information will be _lowlighted_.

Typing a few letters gives you some suggestions.

Experiment!

<div class="clrR"/>

##### RE-DESIGN - Use the DATA Shelf to Change What You See

**Dragging** the <span class="bluePill">BLUE</span> and <span class="greenPill">GREEN</span> variable pills from the _Data Shelf_ onto the _Marks Shelf_ allows you see the data set in different ways.

Note that each pill on the _Marks Shelf_ has options for aggregating the data that are shown :

- _SUM_ - adds up all the values
- _AVG_ - calculates the mean of all the values
- _CNT_ - counts all the values that the mark is representing

And there are others that allow us to see other summary statistics - _variance, \_standard deviation_, etc.

Experiment!<br/>
Try things out.<br/>
Use <code>UNDO</code>.

<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.marksCard.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

<div class="clrR"/>

##### RE-DESIGN - Use the MARKS Shelf to Change How You See It

<div class="imgR">
<img width=158 height=360 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/tableau.marks.options.png"/>
</div>

**Clicking** the **Drop-Down Menu** on the _Marks Shelf_ changes the way the data are visualized.

Finding meaningful graphical representations of data is a big part of _Data Design_ and _Visual Analytics_.

Experiment! Try these options out.<br/>
Try to figure out _what you are seeing_ and _whether it is useful_.<br/>
These are good questions to discuss.

<div class="clrR"/>

##### RE-DESIGN - Use the MARKS Shelf to Refine How It Is Shown

<div class="imgR">
<img width=144 height=45 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/tableau.marks.icons.png"/>
</div>

**Clicking** any of the **Square Icons** on the _Marks Shelf_ gives you all sorts of options :

- you can add _ToolTips_, _Text Labels_ and change how the data are shown.
- you can change _Colour Schemes_, the _Sizes_ of marks, the _Colour_ and _Font_ and _Size_ of the text that you use.

Once again ...<br/>
Experiment! Try these options out.<br/>
Try to figure out _what you are seeing_ and _whether it is useful_.<br/>
Discuss these questions with your colleagues.

<div class="imgR">
<img width=48 height=48 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/tableau.detail.icon.png"/>
</div>

But **ignore the DETAIL pill for now**.<br/>
This aggregates data in ways that we probably don't want for this exercise.

Remember to <code>Save</code> regularly and <code>UNDO</code> when something unexpected happens!

<div class="clrR"/>

##### CREATE - Save An Image When You See Something Interesting

You will need to do this for your submission and presentation.

<code>Worksheet</code>,<code>Export &gt;</code>,<code>Image ...</code>, <code>Save ...</code>

##### ANNOTATE - Add Annotations to Identify Interesting Features

You are attempting to _describe_ and _compare_ and will need to make notes to record the (potentially) interesting things that you see.
Use _annotations_ to make notes about the data in the graphic.

You can annotate _marks_ or _points_ ...

<!--- Tableau Movie  --->
<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.annotate.point.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

Or _areas_ ...

<!--- Tableau Movie  --->
<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.annnotate.area.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

... and format the _mark_, _point_ or _area_ labels and annotations that you make.

We hope to see plenty of informative _annotation_ in the images that you save.

##### CHECK - View the Data that Each Mark Represents

**Tableau** _aggregates_ data, and each mark shows the _sum_ or _average_ or _count_ of the various data items that it represents.

You choose what is shown by interacting with the <span class="bluePill">BLUE</span> and <span class="greenPill">GREEN</span> variable pills on the _Marks Shelf_.

It's useful to _check_ all the data that a mark on a graphic represents.
Do this with a _Right Click_ on any mark in any worksheet, and select <code>View Data</code>.

This gives you the summary - but <code>Full Data</code> shows you all of the _data items_ or _rows_ in the data set that are being used to determine what is shown in the mark.

In the video, we can see that the mark for the _Pancras Road_ station is summarising _155_ data items ... and on closer inspection we can see that these are for each of the 155 times for which we have data.

Unsurprisingly, the _Station Size_ does not change much over this period.

  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.showData.fullData.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

##### DUPLICATE - Make Copies of Worksheets as You Make Progress

You can create _copies_ of worksheets to show different data - and we encourage you to do so.

Right click on the worksheet name and select <code>Duplicate</code>

It's usually a good idea to <code>Save</code> your _Workbook_ before making a major change - like the addition of a new _worksheet_.

<!--- Tableau Movie  --->
<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.duplicate.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

##### ANALYSE - Select Data to Show with the Analytical Map

We have produced a worksheet called '_analytical map_'.

This allows you to select particular days of the week, hours of the day, or combinations of both to help with comparisons.

We might call this _slicing_ the data or _drilling down_ for detail.

Along with all of the above, this should help you with the tasks you have been set.

Once again ...<br/>
Experiment! Try these filters out and see whether you can identify patterns.<br/>

Remember ...

- **describe** your station
- **compare** your station with a colleague
- **compare** stations in your group / area
- **describe** your group / area

Use _annotations_ to record findings and **SAVE** images when you produce a graphic that involves an effective _description_ or _comparison_ or when you see something interesting.

<!--- Tableau Movie  --->
<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.analytical.select.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

We would like to see plenty of informative _annotation_ in your images.
