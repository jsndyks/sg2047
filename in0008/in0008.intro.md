### IN0008 - Data Design Hackathon - Intro

<!---

##### A three-day workshop involving data, maths, computers, graphics, art and teamwork.

--->

---

Our _Data Design Hackathon_ will be looking at data recorded by the [Santander Cycles](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles) bike rental scheme in London and made available by TfL.

You will be working with _recently collected data_ that describes the status and use of about 100 bike stations located around City, University of London, and using _visual analytics software_ to perform numerical analysis and develop informative graphics from the data.

[<img width="80%" style="padding-left:10%;padding-right:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/map.stationsAndGroups.png"/>](https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/map.stationsAndGroups.png)

This will enable you to do _three_ things:

- _Describe individual stations_ - are there particular patterns of usage over time, can we summarise these?<br/> _You will each be allocated a particular bike station to focus on_

- _Compare multiple stations_ - are there particular patterns of usage across an area, can we summarise these?<br/> _You will be looking at pairs and groups of stations_

- _Make suggestions_ - given what we know, how might the bike scheme operators (TfL) improve the scheme?<br/> _You will create and annotate graphics and write a short report to do so_

You will be using the **Tableau** software for visual analytics as the basis of this activity and this will give you some capability in generating graphics from your data.

We hope to get most of this done in _Week 03_.

Just to throw in a different angle and riff on your creativity, we will also be asking you to:

- _Create a beautiful graphic from the data_ - something that has aesthetic quality, is surprising, and that we might want to print out, frame and put on the wall!

This will be the focus for much of the _Week 04_ session.

You will be _working in groups_ for this activity, each group will focus upon a different area of London in their analysis and reporting. Groups will be organised with a maximum group size of six.

You will be working closely with [Prof. Jason Dykes](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/jason-dykes) - a _Professor of Visualization_ in the Department of Computer Science at City - who will be helping you with data analysis, software tools and ideas about visualization, visual analytics and data art.

This will involve short introductory lectures and demos, some sketching exercises, discussion with groups and individuals as they work, and brief plenary interruptions to suggest ‘top tips’ as the work progresses.

You will report your findings in a short presentation that uses graphical and statistical summaries to:

- **describe**, **compare**, **suggest** and **decorate**.

##### Assignments

You will be asked to submit a graphic and a short piece of text after the Week 03 and Week 04 sessions.<br/>These are _voluntary submissions_ made by _individuals_ that help structure your activity direct your efforts.

- [Data Design Assignment - Week 03 - Visual Analytics](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2554493)
- [Data Design Assignment - Week 04 - Data Art](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2555962)

You will be asked to submit a _video presentation_ after Week 05.<br/>This is a _compulsory_ submission that will be assessed and will contribute to your overall module mark.

A link will appear here and on the **Moodle Homepage** when this assignment is open.

##### Outcomes

Having completed the _Data Design_ sessions and exercises you are expected to be able to ...

- **use** _visual analytics software_ to explore, describe and compare aspects of a data set
- **work** _cooperatively_ as a contributing member of a group to complete a task to specification
- **use** _graphics_ to deliver analytical findings in an oral presentation
- **create** _graphics_ from data in visually compelling ways

##### Wish List

In addition, and outside of the formal educational outcomes, I hope that some of you ...

- find out a little bit about the City that you study in
- gain useful transferable skills
- make some thing(s) that you are satisfied with
- get to know some new people, or some old people better
- get a decent free lunch
- begin to develop an interest in data and a love for graphics
- have some fun - _maybe_?
