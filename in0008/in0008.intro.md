### IN0008 - Data Design Hackathon - Intro

<!---

##### A three-day workshop involving data, maths, computers, graphics, art and teamwork.

Our _Data Design Hackathon_ will be looking at data recorded by the [Santander Cycles](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles) bike rental scheme in London and made available by TfL.

You will be working with _recently collected data_ that describes the status and use of about 100 bike stations located around City, University of London, and using _visual analytics software_ to perform numerical analysis and develop informative graphics from the data.

This will enable you to do _three_ things:

- _Describe individual stations_ - are there particular patterns of usage over time, can we summarise these?<br/> _You will each be allocated a particular bike station to focus on_

- _Compare multiple stations_ - are there particular patterns of usage across an area, can we summarise these?<br/> _You will be looking at pairs and groups of stations_

- _Make suggestions_ - given what we know, how might the bike scheme operators (TfL) improve the scheme?<br/> _You will create and annotate graphics and write a short report to do so_

You will be using the **Tableau** software for visual analytics as the basis of this activity and this will give you some capability in generating graphics from your data.

Just to throw in a different angle and riff on your creativity, we will also be asking you to:

- _Create a beautiful graphic from the data_ - something that has aesthetic quality, is surprising, and that we might want to print out, frame and put on the wall!

You will be _working in groups_ for this activity, each group will focus upon a different area of London in their analysis and reporting. Groups will be organised with a maximum group size of six.

You will be working closely with [Prof. Jason Dykes](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/jason-dykes) - a _Professor of Visualization_ in the Department of Computer Science at City - who will be helping you with data analysis, software tools and ideas about visualization, visual analytics and data art.

This will involve short introductory lectures and demos, some sketching exercises, discussion with groups and individuals as they work, and brief plenary interruptions to suggest ‘top tips’ as the work progresses.

You will report your findings in a short presentation that uses graphical and statistical summaries to:

- **describe**, **compare**, **suggest** and **decorate**.

A working lunch will be provided on each of the first two days.
