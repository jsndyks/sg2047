<!--- Task : Week 04 --->

**This is a _voluntary assignment_ that is _not assessed_.**<br/>
But as part of the hackathon we would encourage you participate as this is a nice way of focussing and sharing your effort, and logging your progress.

Once again, we encourage you to upload :

- an **annotated data graphic** that you have created with **Tableau** (in PNG or JPG format) to address the _Data Art_ task
- a **short commentary** on the graphic (use the _online text_ feature in the assignment)

Your _commentary_ should be _less than 100 words in length_.<br/>
It should make direct reference to the graphic, and do one or more of the following things that we aim to achieve in the [Data Art](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2555970) activity ...<br/>

- **define** what makes beautiful data art
- **explain** how your graphic has these qualities
