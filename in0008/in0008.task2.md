### IN0008 - Data Design Hackathon - Data Art

<!---
##### Instructions for the task in which you use a **Tableau** workbook to experiment with **Tableau** and generate _Data Art_.
You will _define_ data art by identifying its qualities, and _explain_ whether, where and how your graphic has some of these characteristics.

In class we did a little thinking about _Data Art_ and you were encouraged to propose, discuss and develop some personal statements that presented a view on three key questions:

<img height="64" width="600" style="padding-left:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/postIt.art.whatIs.png"/><br/>

- what is art?
- what is beauty?
- what is beauty in data design?

You were asked to come up with three statements that finish the statement ...

- **A beautiful data graphic is ...**

Here are some examples from my colleagues.
Don't use these.
But be inspired by them.
And then think of your own.

<img height="64" width="300" style="padding-left:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/postIt.art.jad.png"/><br/>

Now you your criteria, let's look at some _Data Art_.
Does it meet your criteria?

#### giCentre, Computer Science

My colleague in the _Department of Computer Science_, **Prof. Jo Wood** is a digital artist. Jo has exhibited in London and Chicago and uses data in interesting ays in his graphics.

In _We are the City_, which was shown at _Digital Shoreditch_ in 2013 and _The Museum of London_, Jo used data about cycle journeys in London to create a movie that revealed some of the dynamism in the City.

#### Information Is Beautiful Awards

This [Information is Beautiful Awards](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/) from [The Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/) ...

> _celebrate excellence & beauty in data visualization,â€‰infographics, interactives & â€‰information art_

Have a look at some of the award winners and see whether they _meet_ or _change_ your criteria.

Here are a couple of examples by well-known data visualization artists.

##### Science Paths

Data art can be analytic.
Here each line represents a scientist, and each point a paper that they have published over their careers, which span from left to right.

The peaks show the numbers of times that papers have been cited - mentioned in other papers - a key metric of academic impact.

The data graphic makes the point that the most important or impactful papers that scientists write, if assessed by this metric, do not consistently appear at particular stages of careers.

And the interactive features of the data graphic allow you to explore the details.

##### SelfieCity

Data Art might make us think about differences between people and places and reflect upon our own behaviours.

#### Scientific Visualization

Sometimes Art and Science come together.

Has any of this changed your view?

Identify your three criteria.

Use Tableau to make some Data Art.

Submit a screenshot, add your criteria and a short statement that assesses your graphic in relation to these criteria.
