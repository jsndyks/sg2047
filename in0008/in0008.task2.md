### IN0008 - Data Design Hackathon - Data Art

<!---
##### Instructions for the task in which you use a **Tableau** workbook to experiment with **Tableau** and generate _Data Art_.
You will _define_ data art by identifying its qualities, and _explain_ whether, where and how your graphic has some of these characteristics.
  --->

#### TASK!

Work through the text and try the examples.<br/>
Experiment with _Tableau_ out and then **submit a graphic** and a **short statement** to the

- [Data Design Assignment - Week 04 - Data Art](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2555962) assignment area

This should address and explore the following :

- what makes **beautiful data art** (your three statements)
- whether and how **your graphic** has these qualities

Do your best, and see what you come up with.

There are no right or wrong answers, just interesting graphics and opportunities for thinking and expression.

### 1. Beauty in Data Art

In class we did a little thinking about _Data Art_ and you were encouraged to propose, discuss and develop some personal statements that presented a view on three key questions:

<img  width="400" style="padding-left:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/postIt.art.whatIs.jpeg"/><br/>

- **what is art**?
- **what is beauty**?
- **what is beauty in data design**?

You were asked to come up with three statements that finish the statement ...

- **A beautiful data graphic is ...**

Here are some examples from my colleagues.

- **A beautiful data graphic is ...**

<img width="400" style="padding-left:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/postIt.art.mrd.jpeg"/><br/><br/>
<img width="400" style="padding-left:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/postIt.art.jwo.jpeg"/><br/><br/>
<img width="400" style="padding-left:10%" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/postIt.art.jad.jpeg"/><br/>

Don't use these.<br/>
But be inspired by them.<br/>
And then think of your own.

Now you have your criteria, let's look at some _Data Art_.<br/>
Does it meet your criteria?

#### giCentre, Computer Science

We have some _Data Artists_ among the staff in the _Department of Computer Science_.

##### Prof. Jo Wood

Our colleague **Prof. Jo Wood** is a digital artist. Jo has exhibited in London and Chicago and uses data in interesting ays in his graphics.

In _We are the City_, which was shown at _Digital Shoreditch_ in 2013 and _The Museum of London_, Jo used data about cycle journeys in London to create a compelling movie that revealed some of the dynamism in the City.

<img width=95%  src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/joWood.weAreTheCity.png"/>
</div>

Have a look at the movie, _maybe not the whole thing_ as it's quite long, but get a sense of what is revealed in the data.

#### Information Is Beautiful Awards

This [Information is Beautiful Awards](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/) from [The Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/) ...

> _celebrate excellence & beauty in data visualization,â€‰infographics, interactives & â€‰information art_

Have a look at some of the award winners and see whether they _meet_ or _change_ your criteria.

Here are a couple of examples by well-known data visualization artists - but feel free to explore and find others.

##### Science Paths

<div class="imgR">
<img width=95%  src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/iibSciencePaths.v2.png"/>
</div>

_Data Art_ can be analytic.<br/>
Each line in [SciencePaths](http://sciencepaths.kimalbrecht.com/) represents an academic author of scientist, and each point a paper that they have published over their careers, which span from left to right.

The peaks show the numbers of times that papers have been cited - mentioned in other scientific papers. This is a key metric of academic influence and impact.

The data graphic makes the point that the most important or impactful papers that scientists write, if assessed by this metric, do not consistently appear at particular stages of careers.

And the interactive features of the data graphic allow you to explore the details.

##### SelfieCity

_Data Art_ might make us think about differences between people and places and reflect upon our own behaviours.

[SelfieCity](http://selfiecity.net/) contains various interactive graphics that show the different people, contexts and expressions of selfies taken in different cities across the World.

It claims to investigate _selfies_ by analysing 3,200 photos taken in different locations.

> _using a mix of theoretic, artistic and quantitative methods_

<div class="imgR">
<img width=95% src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/iibSelfieCity.png"/>
<!---t r b l --->
<!---style="clip-path: inset(60% 70% 0% 0%)"--->
</div>

There are various interactive graphics, but the ones showing _GENDER AND AGE PROFILES PER CITY_ are particularly interesting.

Each cluster is a _City_, and each point is a _selfie_, positioned on the x-axis according to _approximate age_, and on the y-axis according to _apparent gender_.

- are these _beautiful_ graphics by your criteria?
- what do they tell us?

#### Scientific Visualization

Sometimes Art and Science come together in informative and beautiful ways.

##### Project UKKO

A few years ago, I did some work with the [Project Ukko](https://www.project-ukko.net) team as they developed a visualization to show the likely changes in _wind power_ according to climate prediction models, and the _uncertainty_ around these predictions.

Different weather models, run at different times, with different assumptions, produce different outputs, and this makes it hard to plan (for example) turbine development and make good decisions about likely good turbine locations.

Try it out!

- are these _beautiful_ graphics by your criteria?
- are they informative, useful?

#### Your View

So ...<br/>
Has any of this changed your view?

- **what is beauty in data design**?

You were asked to come up with three statements that finish the statement ...

- **A beautiful data graphic is ...**

Now is time for you to finalise your three criteria.

Write them down ...

- **A beautiful data graphic is ...**

### 2. Making Data Art

The next bit is easy!

Use _Tableau_ to make some _Data Art_.

You have defined it ... now see whether you can do it.

Remember the **Tableau Ground Rules** and the **Tableau Visual Analytics Guidance** in the [Week 03 - Task 1 - Visual Analytics](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2554491) materials, and check back in there to remind yourself how to use _Tableau_.

And then experiment!<br/>
Play around, try things out and see whether you can make anything that meets any of your criteria.

The artists whose work you have seen take many months to perfect their work, so it's unlikely that you will produce something that meets all of your criteria.

The important thing is that you can see how and why and where you do, and how and why and where you don't. That's what we want you to think about, and tell us about.

When you have something interesting, save a graphic and submit this to the [Data Design Assignment - Week 04 - Data Art](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2555962) assignment area.

You will need to do this for your submission and presentation - use the <code>Worksheet</code> menu to do so:

<code>Worksheet</code>, <code>Export &gt;</code>, <code>Image ...</code>, <code>Save ...</code>

Save as a <code>Portable Networks Graphic (PNG)</code>

Add your criteria and a short statement that assesses your graphic in relation to these criteria.
