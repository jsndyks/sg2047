### IN0008 - Data Design Hackathon - Visual Analytics

<!---
##### Instructions for the task in which you use a **Tableau** workbook to _describe_ your station and _compare_ it with others using _Visual Analytics_.
You will begin to _make suggestions_ as to how TfL might improve the scheme.
  --->

---

Be sure to use this exercise in association with the :

- **Tableau Ground Rules**, and
- **Tableau Visual Analytics Guidance**

provided in the [Week 03 - Task 1 - Visual AnalyticsPage](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2554491).

### 2. Tableau Visual Analytics Update

##### **UPDATE DATA** - Load New Data

OK - we have new data this week!

Down load it from [](), and refresh your data set as shown in the following movie.

<!--- Tableau Movie  --->
<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.SwapData.crop.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

Do the patterns that you detected last week persist?

Do the weeks differ?

<div class="clrR"/>

##### **CREATE** - Save An Image When You See Something Interesting

You will need to do this for your submission and presentation.

<code>Worksheet</code>,<code>Export &gt;</code>,<code>Image ...</code>, <code>Save ...</code>

##### **ANNOTATE** - Add Annotations to Identify Interesting Features

You are attempting to _describe_ and _compare_ and will need to make notes to record the (potentially) interesting things that you see.
Use _annotations_ to make notes about the data in the graphic.

You can annotate _marks_ or _points_ ...

<!--- Tableau Movie  --->
<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.annotate.point.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

Or _areas_ ...

<!--- Tableau Movie  --->
<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.annnotate.area.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

... and format the _mark_, _point_ or _area_ labels and annotations that you make.

We hope to see plenty of informative _annotation_ in the images that you save.

##### **CHECK** - View the Data that Each Mark Represents

**Tableau** _aggregates_ data, and each mark shows the _sum_ or _average_ or _count_ of the various data items that it represents.

You choose what is shown by interacting with the <span class="bluePill">BLUE</span> and <span class="greenPill">GREEN</span> variable pills on the _Marks Shelf_.

It's useful to _check_ all the data that a mark on a graphic represents.
Do this with a _Right Click_ on any mark in any worksheet, and select <code>View Data</code>.

This gives you the summary - but <code>Full Data</code> shows you all of the _data items_ or _rows_ in the data set that are being used to determine what is shown in the mark.

In the video, we can see that the mark for the _Pancras Road_ station is summarising _155_ data items ... and on closer inspection we can see that these are for each of the 155 times for which we have data.

Unsurprisingly, the _Station Size_ does not change much over this period.

<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.showData.fullData.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

##### **DUPLICATE** - Make Copies of Worksheets as You Make Progress

You can create _copies_ of worksheets to show different data - and we encourage you to do so.

Right click on the worksheet name and select <code>Duplicate</code>

It's usually a good idea to <code>Save</code> your _Workbook_ before making a major change - like the addition of a new _worksheet_.

<!--- Tableau Movie  --->
<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.duplicate.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

##### **ANALYSE** - Select Data to Show with the Analytical Map

<div class="imgR">
<img width=400 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/img/tableau.analyticalMap.png"/>
</div>

We have produced a worksheet called '_analytical map_'.

This allows you to select particular days of the week, hours of the day, or combinations of both to help with comparisons.

We might call this _slicing_ the data or _drilling down_ for detail.

Along with all of the above, this should help you with the tasks you have been set.

Once again ...<br/>
Experiment! Try these filters out and see whether you can identify patterns.<br/>

Remember ...

- **describe** your station
- **compare** your station with a colleague
- **compare** stations in your group / area
- **describe** your group / area

Use _annotations_ to record findings and **SAVE** images when you produce a graphic that involves an effective _description_ or _comparison_ or when you see something interesting.

<div class="clrR"/>

<!--- Tableau Movie  --->
<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.analytical.select.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

We would like to see plenty of informative _annotation_ in your images.
