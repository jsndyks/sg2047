### IN0008 - Data Design Hackathon - Visual Analytics

<!---
##### Instructions for the task in which you use a **Tableau** workbook to _describe_ your station and _compare_ it with others using _Visual Analytics_.
You will begin to _make suggestions_ as to how TfL might improve the scheme.
  --->

---

Be sure to use this exercise in association with the :

- **Tableau Ground Rules**, and
- **Tableau Visual Analytics Guidance**

provided in the [Week 03 - Task 1 - Visual Analytics](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2554491) exercise.

#### TASK!

Work through the text and watch the movies.<br/>
Try things out and then **submit an annotated graphic** to the

- [Data Design Assignment - Week 03 - Visual Analytics](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2554493)

This should make suggestions as to how TfL might improve the scheme by :

- **Adding** or **Removing** stations?
- **Expanding** or **Contracting** stations?
- **Moving Bikes** between (close) stations?

Do your best, and show your suggestions with annotations on the data where you can.

### Tableau Visual Analytics Update

##### **UPDATE DATA** - Load New Data

OK - bikes have been moving all week long and you have been cycling them (I hope), so .... **we have new data this week**!

Download the data file from the [Week 04 - Data Update](https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2559204), and refresh your data set by adding it to _Tableau_ as shown in the following movie.

</video>
</div>

Do the patterns that you detected last week persist?

Do the weeks differ?

##### **CREATE** - Save An Image When You See Something Interesting

You will need to do this for your submission and presentation.

<code>Worksheet</code>,<code>Export &gt;</code>,<code>Image ...</code>, <code>Save ...</code>

<!---
  - new data,
  filter,
  set,
  annotation,
  layout;

--->

##### **SETS** - Select Particular Data Items and Give Them a Label

_Sets_ are useful for highlighting data items with particular characteristics.

You can select _stations_, _times_, _days_ - anything that is interesting and then colour your graphics according to whether data items fall within or outside the set.

<!--- Tableau Movie  --->
<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.Sets.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

Use _filters_ to refine your graphics and explore the data set.

##### **FILTER** - Create a Filter to Show Data with Particular Characteristics

You can decide what you see and what you hide in your data graphics by creating filters ...

<!--- Tableau Movie  --->
<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.Filter.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

Use _filters_ to refine your graphics and explore the data set.

<div class="clrR"/>

##### **ANNOTATE** - Add Annotations to Identify Interesting Features

You are attempting to _describe_ and _compare_ and will need to make notes to record the (potentially) interesting things that you see.
Use _annotations_ to make notes about the data in the graphic.

You can annotate _marks_ or _points_ or _areas_.

<!--- Tableau Movie  --->
<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.Annotate.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

We hope to see plenty of informative _annotation_ in the images that you save and submit.

<div class="clrR"/>

##### **FILTER** - Create a Week Filter to See How Things Change?

You can _filter_ by <code>DateTime</code> and select <code>Week Number</code> to filter by week of year.

This should allow you to compare this week's data with last week's data.

But in _Tableau_ weeks end on Sunday, whereas the weeks in our data set _start_ on Sunday!

See what you can do!

<!--- Tableau Movie  --->
<div class="tableauMovie">
<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/in0008/mov/tableau.WeekFilter.mov" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
</div>

Does this help you think about how the weeks compare?

Can you think of alternative ways to do this?
